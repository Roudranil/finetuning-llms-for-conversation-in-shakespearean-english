            "original": "   [To Lords without]   Let none disturb us.   Why should    this change of thoughts,    The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,    Be my so used a guest as not an hour,    In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,    The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?    Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,    And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,    Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:    Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,    Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.    Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,    That have their first conception by mis-dread,    Have after-nourishment and life by care;    And what was first but fear what might be done,    Grows elder now and cares it be not done.    And so with me: the great Antiochus,    'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,    Since he's so great can make his will his act,    Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;    Nor boots it me to say I honour him.    If he suspect I may dishonour him:    And what may make him blush in being known,    He'll stop the course by which it might be known;    With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,    And with the ostent of war will look so huge,    Amazement shall drive courage from the state;    Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,    And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:    Which care of them, not pity of myself,    Who am no more but as the tops of trees,    Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,    Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,    And punish that before that he would punish.   ",
            "translated": "[Speaking to Lords outside] Don't let anyone come in here.\u00a0[To himself] Why am I so changed? Why am I sad, downcast, and melancholy every hour of every day? Neither a beautiful day nor a quiet night (which should be where I put my worries to rest) can give me peace. Even when I'm surrounded by things I should enjoy, I can't get rid of this fear of danger waiting for me at Antiochbut there's no way the king could reach me here! And yet, nothing can cheer me up, not even the reality of distance. That's the way the mind works: once we start worrying about something, it only gets worse and worse, until we convince ourselves that the danger is real. Just like that, my fear of Antiochus, who is a much more powerful king than I amand can put his desires into actionhas been blown out of proportion. Even though I haven't said a word, he'll assume I've told his secret. And it won't help for me to say I'm loyal to him, if he's already decided I'm not. If he's determined to keep his secret under wraps, all he has to do is kill me. He'll infiltrate my country with his armies, wage war, and overthrow the government. He'll punish my subjects, too, even though they never did anything to hurt him. I'm more worried about them than I am about myself; I'm just the treetops that protect the roots by which the people grow, and help defend them. It's concern for them that makes my body sick and my soul tired with wanting to punish Antiochus before he punishes us."

Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,    Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,    I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.    From whence an issue I might propagate,    Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.    Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;    The rest   hark in thine ear   as black as incest:    Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father    Seem'd not to strike, but smooth:     but thou    know'st this,    'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.    Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,    Under the covering of a careful night,    Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,    Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.    I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears    Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:    And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,    That I should open to the listening air    How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,    To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,    To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,    And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:    When all, for mine, if I may call offence,    Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:    Which love to all, of which thyself art one,    Who now reprovest me for it,   ",

You see, I went to Antioch where, as you know, I faced death for the chance to win a famously beautiful woman. I had hoped we would get married and have children together, heirs for my throne that would strengthen my rule in this country and delight my subjects. I thought she was beautiful in person, but listen: they were committing incest. Once I figured it out, her sinful father didn't lash out; he suddenly became very smooth. As you well know, it's time to be afraid when tyrants kiss you. I ran away in the dark of night and, once I got here, thought I was safe. I know Antiochus is a tyrant, and that he's probably getting increasingly paranoid about what I know. And if he suspects that I've told the world how he killed all of those princes, and slept with his own daughter, then there's no doubt that he'll invade our country on the pretense of me having offended him.\u00a0Then the country will be plunged into war for my socalled offense, and many innocent people will die, and everyone I love, yourself included, will blame me for it"
