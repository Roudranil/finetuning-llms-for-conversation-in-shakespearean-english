So, on your patience evermore attending,    New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.   ",
            "translated": "You heard about the just deserts that Antiochus and his daughter got for their monstrous actions. And you've seen how Pericles, his queen, and his daughterdespite the bad fortune life threw at themkept their virtue safe from misfortune's attacks, trusted the gods, and are happy at last. You can see that Helicanus is an example of truth, faith, and loyalty; Cerimon displays how wisdom and generosity can do good in the world. Once the word got out about what Cleon and his wife had done, the city of Tarsus (which loved Pericles) reacted in a rage, burning them to death in their own palace. The gods punished them that way for their attempted murderthough they didn't do it, they meant it. So, thanks again for your patience, and may you be blessed! This is the end of our play."
