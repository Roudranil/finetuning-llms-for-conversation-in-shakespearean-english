Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep    Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,    Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;    That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,    They may awake their helps to comfort them.    I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,    And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.   ",
            "translated": "Oh, Dionyza, how can someone who's starving not beg for food? Can he pretend he's not hungry until he dies? We should proclaim our grief loudly, cry out, weep, then shout even louder. Then maybe the gods will wake up from their sleep, take notice of how their creatures are suffering, and help us. I'll start by telling our sad story of the last few years, and you can help me by crying during the pauses."

So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife    Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:    Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;    Here many sink, yet those which see them fall    Have scarce strength left to give them burial.

At one time, the earth, sea, and air were hardly enough to content and please our mouths, though they gave us all the food we needed to survive. Just as houses become run-down from lack of use, our mouths are now starved for lack of exercise. Two years ago we looked for the best recipes to please our palates; now we'd be happy to get a crust a bread, and beg for it. Women who once happily nursed their babies would hardly think it strange that they would now want to eat them. Hunger is such a grim reality that husbands and wives take bets on which of them will die first. Look, there's a man, and there's a woman crying. Here so many are sick that, even when someone dies, no one has the strength to bury them. Isn't this true?"
