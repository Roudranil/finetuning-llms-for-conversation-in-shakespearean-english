At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth    A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,    Wears yet thy silver livery.   She at Tarsus    Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years    He sought to murder:   but her better stars    Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore    Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,    Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she    Made known herself my daughter.

I left my country because I was afraid for my life, and married Thaisa in Pentapolis. She died giving birth to our daughter, Marina, at sea. Marina is still a virgin like you, Diana! Cleon took care of her in Tarsus, but when she was fourteen years old he tried to murder her. Luckily, she came to Mytilene, where, when I arrived, by good fortune she was brought aboard my ship and, by recounting her story, she made it clear she was my daughter."
