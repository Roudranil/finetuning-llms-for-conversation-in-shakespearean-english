His counsel now might do me golden service.    For though my soul disputes well with my sense    That this may be some error, but no madness,    Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune    So far exceed all instance, all discourse,    That I am ready to distrust mine eyes    And wrangle with my reason that persuades me    To any other trust but that I am mad    Or else the ladys mad. Yet if twere so,    She could not sway her house, command her followers,    Take and give back affairs and their dispatch    With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing    As I perceive she does.   Theres something in t    That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.   ",
            "translated": "This is really the air, and that's really the glorious sun. Here's the pearl she gave meI can feel it and see it. And though I'm full of amazement and confusion, I'm not crazy. But where's Antonio, then? I couldn't find him at the Elephant. But he had been there before me, and they told me that he was walking about the town and looking for me. His advice would be like gold to me right now. My soul makes the same strong argument as my senses, which is that all this is some mistake, but that I'm not crazy. Yet this mistake is such a sudden flood of good fortune, which exceeds all my expectations or possibility, that it makes me distrust my own eyes and wrestle with my reason, and suggests that maybe I am insaneor that the lady's insane. But if that were so, she wouldn't be able to run her house, command her servants, and take care of all her business affairs in the smooth, discreet, and stable way that she does. There's something deceptive going on here. But here comes the lady."
