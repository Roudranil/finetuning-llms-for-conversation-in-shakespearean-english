I'll call them back again to comfort me.    Nurse!What should she do here?    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.    Come, vial.   [Holds out the vial]   What if this mixture do not work at all?    Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?    No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.    [Lays down a knife]    What if it be a poison which the friar    Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored    Because he married me before to Romeo?    I fear it isand yet methinks it should not,    For he hath still been tried a holy man.    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,    I wake before the time that Romeo    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point.    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?    Or, if I live, is it not very like    The horrible conceit of death and night,    Together with the terror of the place    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle    Where for this many hundred years the bones    Of all my buried ancestors are packed;    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,    Lies fest'ring in his shroud;   where, as they say,    At some hours in the night spirits resort    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,    So early wakingwhat with loathsome smells,    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,    Environ\u00e8d with all these hideous fears,    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?    O, look! Methinks I see my cousin's ghost    Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body    Upon a rapier's point.   Stay, Tybalt, stay!    Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to thee.   ",

I'll call them back into the room again to comfort me. Nurse!Oh, what good could she do here? I must carry out this dismal performance by myself. Come to me, vial. [She holds out the vial] What if this mixture doesn't work at all? In that case, will I have to get married tomorrow morning? No, no, this knife will forbid that from happening. I'll put you down there. [She lays down the knife]\u00a0\u00a0What if the friar has slyly given me a potion to kill me? Is he afraid that he would be disgraced by marrying me to Paris, because he married me to Romeo first? That's what I'm afraid ofand yet, I think it's probably not the case, because he has always proved to be an honest, holy man. But what if, when I'm laid in the tomb, I wake up before the time Romeo is supposed to come and get me? That frightens me. Will I not feel stifled in that foul vaultwhere no healthy air gets inand die of strangulation before Romeo arrives? Or, if I live, isn't it likely that the horrible thought of death and night, together with the terror of the place, will make me go crazy? There's no place as terrifying as a vault, an ancient container where for over a hundred years my ancestors' bones have been packed in for burial. There bloody Tybalt, so recently alive on the earth, now lies festering in his burial shroud. They say that at some hours of night, spirits visit the tomb. Alas, alas! Is it not likely that I, waking up so earlywhat with the awful smells and the cries like mandrakes ripped out from the earth, making living mortals go crazy after hearing themwill likewise go insane? Oh, if I do wake up in there, will I not be distraught, surrounded with all these terrible fears? Will I go crazy, and play with my forefathers' bones, and take Tybalt's injured corpse out of his shroud? And, in this madness, will I use some noble relative's bone as a club to dash out my hopeless brains? Oh, look there! I think I see my cousin's ghost searching for Romeo, who killed him with a sword, staking him like a piece of meat upon the dagger's point. Wait, Tybalt, wait! Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's a drink. I'll drink to you."
