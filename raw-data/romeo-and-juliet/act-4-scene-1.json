No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade    To wanny ashes, thy eyes windows fall    Like death when he shuts up the day of life.    Each part, deprived of supple government,    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death.

Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.    Then, as the manner of our country is,    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.    In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,    And hither shall he come, and he and I    Will watch thy waking, and that very night    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.    And this shall free thee from this present shame,    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,    Abate thy valor in the acting it.   ",

Your body will go cold, and youll stop breathing. The red of your lips and cheeks will fade to a pale ashen color, and your eyelids will close just as if you were dead. Your body will lose control over its own movement, and will become stiff as that of a corpse. Youll remain in this simulation of death for forty-two hours, and then youll wake as if from a pleasant sleep. So when the bridegroom comes to wake you from your bed in the morning, he will think that you are dead. Then, as is the tradition of our city, youll be dressed in your best clothes and placed on an uncovered funeral bier, and carried to the Capulet tomb that holds all of your dead relatives. Meanwhile, before you wake up, Ill send word to Romeo of our plan. Hell come here, and well keep a watch over you as you wake. That night, Romeo will take you with him to Mantua. So, as long as you dont change your mind or let your womanly fear interfere with your courage, youll be free from the current situation which threatens to force you into sin. "
