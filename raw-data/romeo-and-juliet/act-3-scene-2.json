But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?    That villain cousin would have killed my husband.    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring.    Your tributary drops belong to woe,    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,    And Tybalts dead, that would have slain my husband.    All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?    Some word there was, worser than Tybalts death,    That murdered me. I would forget it fain,    But oh, it presses to my memory,    Like damn\u00e8d guilty deeds to sinners minds.    Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banish\u00e8d.    That banish\u00e8d, that one word banish\u00e8d    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalts death    Was woe enough, if it had ended there.    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship    And needly will be ranked with other griefs,    Why followed not, when she said Tybalts dead,    Thy father or thy mother, nay, or both,    Which modern lamentations might have moved?    But with a rearward following Tybalts death,    Romeo is banish\u00e8d. To speak that word,    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,    All slain, all dead. Romeo is banish\u00e8d.    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,    In that words death. No words can that woe sound. Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?   ",

But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? Because my villain of a cousin would have killed you, my husband. I refuse to cry. These tears which seem like sadness for Tybalts death are actually tears of joy that Romeo is still alive. My husband, whom Tybalt would have killed, is alive. And Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead. This is good news. So why am I crying? Because there was news thats even worse than that of Tybalts death. Worse news that kills me inside. I wish I could forget it, but it forces its way into my memory the way sins obsess guilty minds. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished. That word banished, that single word banished, is worse than the death of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalts death would have been misery enough even if nothing else had happened. Or, if misery loves company, and one grief must necessarily follow another, then it would have been better had the Nurse, after telling me that Tybalt was dead, then told me that my mother or my father, or even both, were gone. That would have pushed me into normal feelings of grief. But to tell me that Tybalts is dead and then say, Romeo has been banished. To say that is the same as saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, are all dead. Romeo has been banished. The death contained in those four words is infinite, unmeasurable. No words can express that misery. Where are my father and mother, Nurse?"
