The sweetest honey    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness    And in the taste confounds the appetite.    Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

Even the most delicious honey is loathsome when youve had too much, and takes away your appetite. Loving in moderation is therefore the key to long-lasting love. Going too fast is as bad as going too slow."
