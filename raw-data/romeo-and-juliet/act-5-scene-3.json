Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,    And she, there dead, that Romeos faithful wife.    I married them, and their stoln marriage day    Was Tybalts doomsday, whose untimely death    Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,    Betrothed and would have married her perforce    To County Paris. Then comes she to me,    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean    To rid her from this second marriage,    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.    Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,    A sleeping potion, which so took effect    As I intended, for it wrought on her    The form of death.    Meantime I writ to Romeo,    That he should hither come as this dire night,    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,    Being the time the potions force should cease.    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,    Was stayed by accident, and yesternight    Returned my letter back. Then all alone    At the prefix\u00e8d hour of her waking    Came I to take her from her kindreds vault,    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,    But when I came, some minute ere the time    Of her awakening, here untimely lay    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.    She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,    And bear this work of heaven with patience.    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.    All this I know, and to the marriage    Her Nurse is privy.   And if aught in this    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life    Be sacrificed some hour before his time    Unto the rigor of severest law.   ",
            "translated": "Ill be brief, because the time I have left to live is not long enough to tell a long story. Romeo, who lies there dead, was Juliets husband. And she, who lies there dead, was Romeos faithful wife. I married them. Their secret wedding day was the same day Tybalt died. His untimely death led to the banishment of the bridegroom. Juliet was distraught not over Tybalts death, but rather over Romeos banishment. To end her grief, you arranged for her to marry Count Paris. At that point she came to me, and, looking wild, threatened to kill herself unless I came up with a plan to help her escape this second marriage. Then I gave her a special sleeping potion that, as I had planned, made it seem as if she had died. Meanwhile, I wrote to Romeo to tell him to come here tonight, this awful night, to help get her out of her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off. But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was stopped by an accident, and returned my letter to me last night. So at the time when Juliet was scheduled to wake up, I came here alone to take her out of her familys tomb. My plan was to hide her in my cell until I could get word to Romeo. But when I arrived, just a few minutes before Juliet awoke, Paris and Romeo were already here, lying dead. She woke up, and I begged her to come out of the tomb with me and bear this work of God with patience. But then a noise frightened me, and I ran from the tomb. She was too desperate to leave with me, and, it seems, she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage. If any of this misfortune is my fault, let me be sacrificed and punished under the strictest law."
