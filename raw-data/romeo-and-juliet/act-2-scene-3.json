Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,    The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry,    I must upfill this osier cage of ours    With baleful weeds and precious-juic\u00e8d flowers.    The earth, thats natu res mother, is her tomb.    What is her burying, grave that is her womb.    And from her womb children of divers kind    We sucking on her natural bosom find,    Many for many virtues excellent,    None but for some and yet all different.    Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live    But to the earth some special good doth give.    Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,    And vice sometime by action dignified.   ",
            "translated": "The morning smiles as it replaces frowning night, and streaks light across the clouds in the east. Darkness staggers away from the suns path like a drunkard. Now, before the sun rises, bringing on the day and drying the dew, I must fill my basket with poisonous weeds and the precious nectar of flowers. The earth is both natures mother and its tomb. Plants arise from the earth as from a womb, and when they die, they are buried in the earth. Many different plants and animals come from the earths womb. All of these children find nourishment from the earth, and all have some special, unique virtue. There is a power that resides in herbs, plants, and stones. For theres nothing on earth thats so evil that it does not also provide the earth with some kind of good. Nor is there anything so good that it cant be turned bad if its abused and used incorrectly. Virtue, when misused, turns to vice, while vice can sometimes become virtue through proper action."

Therefore, the fact that youre awake so early makes it clear that some anxiety has you in its grip. Or, if thats not true, then Id guess that you actually never went to sleep at all tonight."
