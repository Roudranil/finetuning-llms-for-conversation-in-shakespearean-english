Loves heralds should be thoughts,    Which ten times faster glide than the suns beams,    Driving back shadows over louring hills.    Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill    Of this days journey,   and from nine till twelve    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,    She would be as swift in motion as a ball.    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,    And his to me.    But old folks, many feign as they were dead,    Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.    O God, she comes.O honey Nurse, what news?    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away  .  ",

Loves messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams and drive the shadows back over the dark and scowling hills. Thats how fast swift-winged doves carry the goddess of love in her chariot, and why Cupid has wings that propel him as quickly as the wind. Now the sun is at its highest point in the skyits noon. Three hours have passed since nine oclock, and yet she hasnt returned. If she were young and in love, shed move as fast as a struck tennis ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But old people act as though theyre already deadawkward, slow, heavy, and pale as lead. Oh God, shes here! Sweet Nurse, whats your news? Did you meet with him? Send your servant away."
