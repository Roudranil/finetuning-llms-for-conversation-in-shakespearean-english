He is a man, setting his fate aside,    Of comely virtues:    Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice    An honour in him which buys out his fault    But with a noble fury and fair spirit,    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,    He did oppose his foe:    And with such sober and unnoted passion    He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,    As if he had but proved an argument.

My friend, this action aside, is a good man, who in the moment actually acted without cowardicesomething which ought to be held against his crimeby bravely identifying and responding to one who had ruined his reputation.

Your rhetoric reaches almost to the point of labor as it tries to turn murder into a mere formality and feuding into an act of valor. Feuds actually prove to be valor in its most degenerate form, as they come from the formation of rivalries. A man is truly valiant only when he can endure the worst insults men can speak, and even wear them like clothing without a care in the world. True valor never takes injury to heart, or retaliates in violence. If acts of injustice are in fact evil and force us to kill others, how dumb it would be then to risk your life for such a cause!"

If there be    Such valour in the bearing, what make we    Abroad? why then, women are more valiant    That stay at home,   if bearing carry it,    And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon    Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,    If wisdom be in suffering.   O my lords,    As you are great, be pitifully good:    Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?    To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;    But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.

Why do they not patiently let those same enemies murder them in their sleep?

Why do we not deem the donkey superior to the lion, or the prisoner to the judge, if there is such wisdom in suffering? You are great men, be compassionate. Who would not sentence a man for violent aggression? You are right, murder is the greatest sin, but when it is done for self-defense it is fair. Anger is wicked, but who has not been angry before?
