Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,    That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,    But his occasion might have woo'd me first;    For, in my conscience, I was the first man    That e'er received gift from him:    And does he think so backwardly of me now,    That I'll requite its last? No:    So it may prove an argument of laughter    To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.    I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum,    Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;    I'd such a courage to do him good.

All his friends benefitted from the charity that leaves him without money, and now leave him for broke like doctor does a case he has deemed helpless. Must I now try to cure him of his debts? What a disgrace and an unenviable position for me! I cannot understand why he did not come to me firstI was the first to receive a gift from him, after all. Does he think so poorly of me as to believe I would be the last to repay him? No, and that way I'll have reason to laugh at him and all the others, who have called me an idiot. If Timon had approached me first, I would have three times the amount he asks for. But now, servant, go back to him and tell him this: whoever scorns me this way will never get my money.\u00a0"

The    devil knew not what he did when he made man    politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot    think but, in the end, the villainies of man will    set him clear.   How fairly this lord strives to    appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,    like those that under hot ardent zeal would set    whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his    politic love.    This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,    Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,    Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards    Many a bounteous year must be employ'd    Now to guard sure their master.    And this is all a liberal course allows;    Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.   ",

He ruined himself in the process, and there's no way that all the badness in men will ever absolve him. It is incredible how this lord actually works to seem horrible! He makes himself seem virtuous, but only so he can be as wicked as those who would burn entire empires to the ground. That's what political desire is made of. He was Timon's best chance at getting money, and now all hopes are gone except for the will of the gods. Timon's friends are dead to him, and now all those doors he had left wide open all those years must be closed and used to protect him in his home. That's what being too generous gets you. He who cannot hang onto wealth must at least hang onto his house."
