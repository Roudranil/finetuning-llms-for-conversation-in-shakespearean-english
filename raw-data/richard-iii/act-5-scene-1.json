That high All-seer which I dallied with    Hath turned my feign\u00e8d prayer on my head    And given in earnest what I begged in jest.    Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men    To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.    Thus Margarets curse falls heavy upon my neck:    When he, quoth she, shall split thy heart with sorrow,    Remember Margaret was a prophetess.    Come, lead me, officers, to the block of shame.    Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.   ",

This is the punishment that I once wished might fall on me if I was ever false to King Edward's children or his wife's allies. This is the punishment I wished might fall on methat I would be betrayed by the man I trusted most. This, this All Souls' Day, is the predestined punishment for my frightened soul. I tried to play games with Godthe all-knowing seerbut he has turned my false prayer on my head and earnestly given me what I asked for as a joke. This is how he forces wicked men to turn their swords against their masters. Now Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck. \"When Richard splits your heart in two with sorrow,\" she said, \"remember that Margaret was a prophetess.\""
