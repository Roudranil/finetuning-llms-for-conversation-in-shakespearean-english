If I have killed the issue of your womb,    To quicken your increase I will beget    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.    A grandams name is little less in love    Than is the doting title of a mother.

Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,    This fair alliance quickly shall call home    To high promotions and great dignity.

A grandmother is hardly loved less than a mother. Grandchildren are just one step removed from children, made of your same substance and your very blood. They take the same amount of effort, minus that one night of labor which you suffered for your daughter's sake. Your children troubled you in your youth, but my children will comfort you in your old age. Your only real loss is that your son wasn't king, but through that loss your daughter will become queen. I can't repay you as much as I'd like to, so accept what kindness I can offer. Your son Dorsetwho fled in fear and joined the French army against mewould come quickly home to high promotions and great dignity if this marriage takes place. The king who calls your beautiful daughter \"wife\" will call Dorset \"brother.\" Once again you'll be the mother to a king, and all the ruins of unhappy times will be repaired with double their value in contentment. Why, we can look forward to many good days ahead! The liquid tears you've shed will return, transformed into pearls. Your happiness will increase to ten times its original size, plus interest. Go then, my future mother-in-law; go to your daughter. Use your experience to make her bold in her youthful innocence. Prepare her ears to hear my courting words. Put in her tender heart the ambition to be queen. Acquaint the Princess with the sweet, silent hours of joy in marriage, and when I've punished that petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham, I will return crowned with victory wreaths and lead your daughter to a conquerer's bed.
