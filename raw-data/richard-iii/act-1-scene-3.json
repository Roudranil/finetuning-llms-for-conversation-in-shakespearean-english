Did Yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven    That Henrys death, my Lovelly Edwards death,    Their kingdoms loss, my woeful banishment,    Could all but answer for that peevish brat?    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,    As ours by murder to make him a king.     [to QUEEN ELIZABETH]     Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,    Die in his youth by like untimely violence.    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,    Outlive they glory, like my wretched self.    Long mayst thou live to wail they children's death    And see another, as I see thee now,    Decked in they rights, as thou art stalled in mine.    Long die thy happy days before they death,    And, after many lengthened hours of grief,    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen.    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son    Was stabbed with bloody daggers.   God I pray Him    That none of you may live his natural age,    But by some unlooked accident cut off.   ",
