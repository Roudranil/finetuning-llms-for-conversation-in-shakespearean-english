            "original": "   Now is the winter of our discontent    Made glorious summer by this son of York,    And all the clouds that loured upon our house    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,    Our bruis\u00e8d arms hung up for monuments,    Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.    Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;    And now, instead of mounting barb\u00e8d steeds    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,    He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.    But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,    Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;    I, that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;    I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,    Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time    Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,    And that so lamely and unfashionable    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,    Have no delight to pass away the time,    Unless to see my shadow in the sun    And descant on mine own deformity.    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,    I am determin\u00e8d to prove a villain    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,    By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,    To set my brother Clarence and the king    In deadly hate, the one against the other;    And if King Edward be as true and just    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,    This day should Clarence closely be mewed up    About a prophecy which says that G    Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be.    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.   ",
            "translated": "Now the winter of our troubles has been transformed into glorious summer by the ascension of my brother, King Edward IV, son of the house of York. All the clouds that had descended over our family have now been banished and returned to the sea. Now we wear wreaths of victory on our foreheads, and we've hung up our armor as decoration. We've exchanged the sound of our battle trumpets for the sound of joyful greetings, and our death marches have become stately dances. The grim, warlike expressions on our faces have smoothed. And instead of charging on armored horses to frighten our opponents, we now dance in ladies' chambers to seductive songs on the lute. But as for me, I am not made for such games of love, or to admire myself in a mirror. I was badly made, and I lack the good looks to strut in front of passing girls. Nature has cheated me out of handsome features and proper proportions. I was born deformed, unfinished, and born prematurely. I was barely half-created when I came into the world, and left so lame and misshapen that dogs bark at me as I limp past them. In such delicate times of peace, I have nothing to do. No joys help me pass the time, unless I want to see my own shadow in the sun and make speeches about my deformity. Therefore, since I cannot amuse myself by being a lover during these peaceful days, I am determined to become a villain. I have hatched plots and put dangerous plans into action, using prophecies made while drunk; slander; and stories about dreams in order to set my brother George, Duke of Clarence, against my other brother, the king, so that they hate each other. If King Edward is as true as I am clever, false, and treacherous, then this very day Clarence will be imprisoned because of a prophecy that \"G\"\u00a0will murder Edward's children. But, you thoughts, hide yourselves deep down in my soul, for here comes Clarence."
