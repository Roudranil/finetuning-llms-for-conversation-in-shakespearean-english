I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,    'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver    him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;    and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he    steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:    O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself    in all companies! I would have, as one should say,    one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,    as it were, a dog at all things.   If I had not had    more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,    I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I    live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge.   He    thrusts me himself into the company of three or four    gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had    not been therebless the mark!a pissing while, but    all the chamber smelt him.   'Out with the dog!' says    one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him    out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.    I, having been acquainted with the smell before,    knew it was Crab,   and goes me to the fellow that    whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip    the dog?'   'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he.   'You do him    the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you    wot of.'   He makes me no more ado, but whips me out    of the chamber.   How many masters would do this for    his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the    stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had    been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese    he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.    Thou thinkest not of this now.   Nay, I remember the    trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam    Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I    do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make    water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? Didst    thou ever see me do such a trick?   ",

I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, \"I would teach a dog like this.\" I was sent to deliver him as a present from my master to Mistress Silvia, and as soon as I came into the dining room, he comes to her plate and steals her chicken leg. Oh, it's a horrible thing when a dog can't behave himself in different kinds of company! But, as they really should say, I happen to have a dog that is a dog indeeda dog in everything he does. If I didn't have more wisdom than he doesto plead guilty for his wrongdoingI really think he would have been hanged for it. For as sure as I live, he's suffered for it, as you'll see. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanly dogs under the Duke's table. He had not been there (pardon my language) as long as the time it takes to pissand everybody in the room smelled him. \"Out with the dog!\" someone says. \"What dog is that?\" someone else says. \"Whip him!\" a third says. \"Hang him up\" says the Duke. Since I have known the smell before, I knew it was Crab. So I go to the man that whips the dogs: \"Friend,\" I say, \"are you going to whip the dog?\" \"Yes, I am\" he says. \"You'll make things even worse for him if you do,\" I say. \"I was the one who did the thing you know about.\" He makes no more fuss about it, but whips me out of the room. How many masters would do this for their servants? No, I swear, I have sat in the stocks for sausages he has stolen. Otherwise, he would have been executed. I have also been punished for geese he has killed. Otherwise, he would have suffered for it. Don't think about this now. No, I remember the trick you played on me when I left Madam Silvia. Didn't I ask you to always pay attention to me, just like I pay attention to you? When did you see me raise up my leg and urinate onto a gentlewoman's skirt? Have you ever seen me do such a trick?"
