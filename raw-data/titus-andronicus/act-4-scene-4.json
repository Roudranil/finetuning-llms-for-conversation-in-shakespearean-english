And what an if    His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,    Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,    His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?    And now he writes to heaven for his redress:    See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;    This to Apollo; this to the god of war;    Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!    What's this but libelling against the senate,    And blazoning our injustice every where?    A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?    As who would say, in Rome no justice were.    But if I live, his feigned ecstasies    Shall be no shelter to these outrages:    But he and his shall know that justice lives    In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,    He'll so awake as she in fury shall    Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.

And so what if he's gone crazy? Do we have to deal with the consequences of his fits and bitterness? And now he writes to heaven for justice. See [shows arrows], here's to Jove, and this one's to Mercury; to Apollo, to the god of war . . . and these papers are scattered throughout the streets of Rome! Isn't this libel against the Senate, accusing us of injustice everywhere? Good ammunition, my lords, for those would say there's no justice in Rome.
