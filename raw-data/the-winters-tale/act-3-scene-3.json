To me comes a creature,    Sometimes her head on one side, some another;    I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,    So fill'd and so becoming:   in pure white robes,    Like very sanctity, she did approach    My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,    And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes    Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon    Did this break-from her:   'Good Antigonus,    Since fate, against thy better disposition,    Hath made thy person for the thrower-out    Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,    Places remote enough are in Bohemia,    There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe    Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,    I prithee, call't.   For this ungentle business    Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see    Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks    She melted into air.   Affrighted much,    I did in time collect myself and thought    This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:    Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,    I will be squared by this.   I do believe    Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that    Apollo would, this being indeed the issue    Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,    Either for life or death, upon the earth    Of its right father.   Blossom, speed thee well!    There lie, and there thy character: there these;    Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,    And still rest thine.   The storm begins; poor wretch,    That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed    To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,    But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I    To be by oath enjoin'd to this.   Farewell!    The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have    A lullaby too rough: I never saw    The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!    Well may I get aboard!   This is the chase:    I am gone for ever.   ",
            "translated": "Come here, poor baby. I've heard (but haven't believed) stories about spirits of the dead walking the earth. If these things do happen, then your mother appeared to me last night in a dream that was so real, it felt like I was awake. Something walked toward me, moving its head from side to side. I've never seen anything so sad and so completely beautiful. In pure white robes, like a goddess, she walked toward the place where I was sleeping. She bowed three times, gasping as she tried to speak. Crying with rage, she finally burst out, \"Antigonus, you have the bad luck to be disposing of my baby far away in Bohemia. Shed a tear as you leave her there. Since she's lost forever, you should call her 'Perdita.' And for what my husband has made you do, you'll never see your wife, Paulina, again.\" Then, shrieking, she disappeared into thin air. Terrified, it took me a while to collect myself, and I wasn't sure if it was a dream or not. Usually I don't put much stock in dreams, but this one I'd swear by superstitiously. I believe that Hermione died, and that Apollo wants this baby (who must be King Polixenes's daughter) to be laid here on its father's land, to either live or die. [He places the baby on the ground in a basket with a letter and some jewels]\u00a0 Good luck! There you are, and there's the story of your identity. If you make it, these things might help you. The storm is beginning! Poor brat, you're out in the elements thanks to your mother's mistake, and who knows what will happen! I can't cry, but my heart is bleeding and I'm damned for getting tangled up in this.\u00a0Goodbye! It's getting darker and darker. I'm afraid the lullaby you're about to get will be a little on the rough side; I've never seen the sky so black in the daytime.\u00a0The thunder, the lightning! I need to get aboard the ship!
