Honestly? My life is about as precious to me as my grief, which I'd rather not have to bear. I care about my reputation because it affects my children's future; that's the only reason I stand here now.Sir, I appeal to your own conscience. Remember how much you loved meand how much I deserved itbefore Polixenes came to your court. Since he came, I've only tried to remain worthy of your love.

Prithee, bring me    To the dead bodies of my queen and son:    One grave shall be for both: upon them shall    The causes of their death appear, unto    Our shame perpetual.   Once a day I'll visit    The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there    Shall be my recreation: so long as nature    Will bear up with this exercise, so long    I daily vow to use it.   Come and lead me    Unto these sorrows.   ",
            "translated": "No, you said the right thing; you spoke the truth. I welcome it, actually, more than I would welcome your pity. Please, show me the dead bodies of my wife and son. I'll make them a double grave, and, as a mark of my shame, will write on their gravestones how and why they died. I'll visit the chapel where they're buried every day and will spend all my time crying over them. I'll do this for as long as I live. Lead me to my heartbreak.\u00a0"
