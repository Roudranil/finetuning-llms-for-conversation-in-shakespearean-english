Of that fatal    country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very    naming punishes me with the remembrance of that    penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,    my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen    and children are even now to be afresh lamented.    Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my    son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not    being gracious, than they are in losing them when    they have approved their virtues.   ",
            "translated": "Camillo, if you're loyal to me, you wouldn't think of leaving me now; I need your services especially (and, since I've been spoiled with a servant as effective as you, I can hardly settle for someone else). Plus, you've built industries for me here that no one but you can take care of, so you either need to stay here to do it yourself, or take your projects with you. I can never thank you enough for all the work you've doneand for your friendship. Please, don't talk about Sicily anymore. The name alone dredges up bad memories of that \"remorseful\" king (as you call him), my friend, and the loss of his wife and children, which we should be mourning even now. Anyway, when did you last see my son, Prince Florizel? It's just as bad for a king to misplace a good son as to have a bad one at hand."
