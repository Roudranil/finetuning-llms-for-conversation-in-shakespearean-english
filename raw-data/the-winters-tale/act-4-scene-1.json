Impute it not a crime    To me or my swift passage, that I slide    O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried    Of that wide gap, since it is in my power    To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour    To plant and o'erwhelm custom.   Let me pass    The same I am, ere ancient'st order was    Or what is now received: I witness to    The times that brought them in; so shall I do    To the freshest things now reigning and make stale    The glistering of this present, as my tale    Now seems to it.   Your patience this allowing,    I turn my glass and give my scene such growing    As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,    The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving    That he shuts up himself,   imagine me,    Gentle spectators, that I now may be    In fair Bohemia, and remember well,    I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel    I now name to you; and with speed so pace    To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace    Equal with wondering:   what of her ensues    I list not prophecy; but let Time's news    Be known when 'tis brought forth.    A shepherd's daughter,    And what to her adheres, which follows after,    Is the argument of Time.   Of this allow,    If ever you have spent time worse ere now;    If never, yet that Time himself doth say    He wishes earnestly you never may.   ",
            "translated": "I reveal alljoy and terror, good and bad, mistakes made and mistakes paid for to the benefit of some and to the detriment of others. I am Time, and I came here to flap my wings. Don't blame me for flying by, passing over sixteen years as if it were nothing. It's within my power to defy the rules and pack all of this into a single hour. I am the same now as I have been since ancient times, since the dawn of Time. I'm about to bring in something fresh and new to liven up our current tale, which is as old (and stale) as Time.[TIME turns an hourglass over in his hand] If you don't mind, I'll turn my hourglass to while away the years before our next scene as quickly as if you'd slept through it. We'll leave Leontes there. He regretted the consequences of his jealousy so much that he shut himself away. Those of you in the audience: imagine I'm in Bohemia now. Remember when I mentioned the king's son? Now I can tell you that his name is Florizel, and I'll also tell you that Perdita has grow up into a beautiful woman. I won't tell you what becomes of her; you'll see everything in due Time. She was raised as a shepherd's daughter, and what happens to her next only Time will tell. Bear with us for the next part; you'll be glad you took the Time. Ever had a worse Time than you've had watching this play? Well, Time himself hopes that you never will.\u00a0"
