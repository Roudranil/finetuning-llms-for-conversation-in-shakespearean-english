The pale moon shines by night:    And when I wander here and there,    I then do most go right.    If tinkers may have leave to live,    And bear the sow-skin budget,    Then my account I well may, give,    And in the stocks avouch it.    My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen.   My father named me Autolycus; who being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.   With die and drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway:   beating and hanging are terrors to me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it.   A prize! a prize!   ",
