Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls    Since presently your souls must part your bodies    With too much urging your pernicious lives,    For 'twere no charity;   yet, to wash your blood    From off my hands, here in the view of men    I will unfold some causes of your deaths.    You have misled a prince, a royal king,    A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,    By you unhappied and disfigured clean:    You have in manner with your sinful hours    Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,    Broke the possession of a royal bed    And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks    With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.    Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,    Near to the king in blood, and near in love    Till you did make him misinterpret me,    Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,    And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,    Eating the bitter bread of banishment;    Whilst you have fed upon my signories,    Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,    From my own windows torn my household coat,    Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,    Save men's opinions and my living blood,    To show the world I am a gentleman.    This and much more, much more than twice all this,    Condemns you to the death.   See them deliver'd over    To execution and the hand of death.   ",

Bushy and Green, I won't bother with your soulssince they'll be parted from your body soon anywayby telling you what an evil life you've led, since that will be no help. But to justify myself, \u00a0I will publicly explain some reasons why you must die. You have misled a prince, a royal kinga gentleman happy in his ancestry, disfigured, and made unhappy by you. Your sinfulness has caused a divorce between his queen and him, since he spent his time away from the marriage bed, amusing himself with you. You have stained the queen's cheeks with tears from your awful wrongs. I was myself a prince, near to the king in fortune and blood, until you made him misinterpret me, and have stooped my neck under your crimes, sighing my English breath in foreign lands and eating the bitter bread of banishment. Meanwhile, you have used my seal for your own gain, ruined my land and cut down my trees, and destroyed my coat of arms in my own windowsleaving me no sign, except men's opinions and my living blood, to show the world I am a gentleman. This and much more, much more than twice all this, condemns you to die. [To Northumberland] See them delivered over to execution and the hand of death."
