Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,    That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee    Made him a man   ; and though thou livest and breathest,    Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent    In some large measure to thy father's death,    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,    Who was the model of thy father's life.    Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:    In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:    That which in mean men we intitle patience    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.    What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.   ",

Ah, Gaunt, his blood was yours! You were born from the same blood, the same womb; the same metal that molded you made him a man too! And although you live and breathe, you are dead in him. You have allowed your father's death, by seeing your poor brother die, who so strongly resembled his father. Don't fool yourself by saying this is patience, Gaunt: it's despair. In allowing your brother to be slaughtered, you've shown them how to kill you: what in poor men we call patience is just cold cowardice in noblemen. What more can I say?
