My trusty servant, well approved in all,    Here let us breathe and haply institute    A course of learning and ingenious studies.    Pisa, renown\u00e8d for grave citizens,    Gave me my being and my father first,    A merchant of great traffic through the world,    Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.    Vincentios son, brought up in Florence,    It shall become to serve all hopes conceived    To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.    And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study    Virtue, and that part of philosophy    Will I apply that treats of happiness    By virtue specially to be achieved.

And now, thanks to my father's love and approval, and your own good companyhere I am. So, my trusty, dependable servant, let's rest here a while and begin a course of intellectual studies. I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, along with my father before me: Vincentio of the Bentivoli family. He was a successful merchant and world traveler, and it now seems fitting that I, Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence, should fulfill all my father's hopes for me and increase his wealth with my own virtuous deeds. And therefore, Tranio, I will study virtue for now, and that area of philosophy that discusses how to achieve happiness through virtue. But tell me what you think of all this, for I have left Pisa and come to Padua, and now I feel like I've left a puddle behind and jumped into an ocean, hoping to quench my thirst."
