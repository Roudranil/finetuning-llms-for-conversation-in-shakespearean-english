            "original": "   Fie, fie! Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow    And dart not scornful glances from those eyes    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.    It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,    And in no sense is meet or amiable.    A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,    Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,    And for thy maintenance commits his body    To painful labor both by sea and land,    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,    And craves no other tribute at thy hands    But love, fair looks and true obedience    Too little payment for so great a debt.    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,    Even such a woman oweth to her husband.    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,    And not obedient to his honest will,    What is she but a foul contending rebel    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?    I am ashamed that women are so simple    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;    Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,    But that our soft conditions and our hearts    Should well agree with our external parts?    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,    My heart as great, my reason haply more,    To bandy word for word and frown for frown.    But now I see our lances are but straws,    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,    And place your hands below your husbands foot:    In token of which duty, if he please,    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.   ",
            "translated": "For shame, for shame! Don't furrow your brow and glare so scornfully to try to wound the man who is your lord, your king, and your governor. It tarnishes your beauty like frost blights the meadows, and ruins your reputation like a strong wind shaking a flower bud. In no sense whatsoever is it appropriate or pleasant. An angry woman is like a stirred-up fountainmuddy, ugly, thick, lacking beautyand while it's in this condition, no one, not even a dry or thirsty man, will stoop to sip or touch one drop of it. Your husband is your lord, your life, your keeper, your head, your ruler, and one who cares for you. To keep you safe and comfortable he commits his body to painful labor on both sea and land, to staying awake on stormy nights and cold days at sea, while you stay at home, warm and secure. And in exchange all he asks for is love, beauty, and true obediencetoo little payment for so great a debt. A woman owes her husband the same obedience that a subject owes to his prince. And when she is stubborn, peevish, sullen, sour, and not obedient to his honest will, then what is she but a foul, vicious rebel, and a cursed traitor to her loving lord? I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should kneel and plead for peace. I'm ashamed that they should seek rulership, supremacy, and power when they are obligated to serve, love and obey. Why else are our bodies so soft and weak and smooth, unfit for labor and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts? Come, come, you weak, willful worms! My mind was once just as arrogant as yours, my courage just as great, and my wit perhaps even better when it came to tossing words back and forth and exchanging frowns for frowns. But now I see that our swords are only straws, our strength is just as weak, and our weakness is beyond compare, so that we seem to be exactly the thing we are not. So humble your pride, for it's useless. Place your hands beneath your husband's boot as a gesture of obedience. My hand is always ready to comfort and pleasure my husband, if he wants me to."
