Be quiet then as men should be,    Till he hath pass'd necessity.    I'll show you those in troubles reign,    Losing a mite, a mountain gain.    The good in conversation,    To whom I give my benison,    Is still at Tarsus,   where each man    Thinks all is writ he speken can;    And, to remember what he does,    Build his statue to make him glorious:    But tidings to the contrary    Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?

            "translated": "Here you've seen a king commit incest with his daughter. Pericles will turn out to be a much more powerful prince and a better ruler, strong in both word and deed. But now he has to keep his mouth shut, until enough time has passed. I'll show you how much trouble he had to deal with; once he got over the molehill, he ran into a mountain. That good man whom I bless, Pericles, is still at Tarsus, where everyone is singing his praises and the city is erecting a statue of him to remember him byeverything seems happy. But what you're about to see contradicts that, so what can I say?"

He, doing so, put forth to seas,    Where when men been, there's seldom ease;    For now the wind begins to blow;    Thunder above and deeps below    Make such unquiet, that the ship    Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;    And he, good prince, having all lost,    By waves from coast to coast is tost:    All perishen of man, of pelf,    Ne aught escapen but himself;    Till fortune, tired with doing bad,    Threw him ashore, to give him glad:    And here he comes. What shall be next,    Pardon old Gower,this longs the text.   ",
            "translated": "Back at home, Helicanus has hardly been a lazy worker bee: he's done everything the prince asked him to, and has sent news of everything happening in Tyre. He told Pericles how Thaliard came to murder him, and advised him not to stay in Tarsus much longer. Pericles sailed away on the sea, where men can never rest easy, and was quickly caught up in a storm. The winds blew, loud thunder was heard, and the ship that should have kept him safe was wrecked.\u00a0Having lost everything, Pericles was tossed by waves from coast to coast. He had\u00a0nothing and no one to keep him company, since no one else escaped alive. Finally, fortune got tired of ruining his life, and threw him on shore to make him happy. Here he comes. What happens nextactually, I'll shut up now."
