            "original": "   Twenty-three days    They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells    The great Apollo suddenly will have    The truth of this appear.   Prepare you, lords;    Summon a session, that we may arraign    Our most disloyal lady,   for, as she hath    Been publicly accused, so shall she have    A just and open trial.   While she lives    My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,    And think upon my bidding.   ",
            "translated": "They've been gone for twenty-three days; they've made good time. That bodes well for the truth Apollo will give us soon.[To the remaining gentlemen]\u00a0Men, get ready for a special meeting so that we can have a trial for Hermione. Since I've accused her publicly, she should have a just and open trial. As long as she lives, it'll weigh on my heart. Now leave me alone, and go carry out my orders."
