Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say    No grief did ever come so near thy heart    As when thy lady and thy true love died,    Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.

Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,    But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,    And on the justice of my flying hence,    To keep me from a most unholy match,    Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.    I do desire thee, even from a heart    As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,    To bear me company and go with me:    If not, to hide what I have said to thee,    That I may venture to depart alone.

And I have heard you say that you have never felt more grief in your heart than you did when your ladyyour true lovedied. And you have vowed pure chastity on her grave. Sir Eglamour, I want to go to Valentine in Mantua, where I heard he is. And since the journey is dangerous, I would like your worthy company, because I rely on your faith and honor. Don't encourage my father's anger, Eglamour. Just think about my griefa lady's griefand about the justice of my running away from here; and from a most unholy marriagewhich heaven and fortune would always make horrible. This is coming from a heart as full of sorrows as the sea is full of sand. I want you to keep me company and go with me. If you won't then keep secret what I have said to you so that I may go alone."
