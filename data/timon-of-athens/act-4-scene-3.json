Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;    The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,    The beggar native honour.    It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,    The want that makes him lean.   Who dares, who dares,    In purity of manhood stand upright,    And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,    So are they all; for every grise of fortune    Is smooth'd by that below:   the learned pate    Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;    There's nothing level in our cursed natures,    But direct villany.

In the case of twin brothers, who were identically conceived, housed, and born out of the same womb into a world with different fortunes, it is the one with more who scorns the one with less. Human nature is subject to many evils, and cannot bear great riches without reserving contempt for those without such luxuries. I will become a beggar and restrain the lord within me, for the senator will be scorned, the beggar honored. Whether or not one is wealthy is only a matter of luck: if an ox is born into abundant pastures, he will grow fat, whereas if he is born into scarcity, he will grow thin. Who? Who will dare to stand up for what's right and call a man a flatterer? After all, if one man is a flatterer, so is everyone, because every level in a hierarchy is flattered by the one below it. Smart men bow to rich fools. Everything is ridiculous, because we have nothing rational within our nature, just straight villainy. Thus I hate all feasts, society, and groups of people! Timon hates anything that resemblesor ishimself. All men go to hell! Earth, where are your roots?"

Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,    Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,    And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;    His antidotes are poison, and he slays    Moe than you rob:   take wealth and lives together;    Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,    Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.    The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction    Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,    And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:    The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves    The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,    That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen    From general excrement   :   each thing's a thief:    The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power    Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,    Rob one another. There's more gold.   Cut throats:    All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,    Break open shops; nothing can you steal,    But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this    I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!

Do not trust the doctor, though, because his cures are poisonous and he kills men even more often than you rob them, taking both money and lives. Wreak havoc as your occupation dictates, \u00a0and like one being instructed in his occupation, I'll give you good examples of thieves. The sun is a thief for robbing water from the vast sea; the moon is a thief for snatching light off the sun; the sea is a thief as its tides surge forth, dissolve the moon into salty tears; the earth is a thief as it steals and feeds off the manure of animals. Everything is a thief, from the laws to its enforcement, which use their unlimited power to steal. And do not make yourselves the exception, go away and rob one another. Here's some more gold. Go cut some throats, because everyone you meet is a thief. Go to Athens, pillage shops, because nothing you steal will not come from a thief's pocket. Do not steal any less because I'm giving you this, more gold, which I hope may curse you! Amen."
