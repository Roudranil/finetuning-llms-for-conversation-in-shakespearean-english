Alas, kind lord!    He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat    Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to    Supply his life, or that which can command it.    I'll follow and inquire him out:    I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;    Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.   ",

It's a strange curse when a man's worst sin is that he does too much good! Who will ever dare to be half as kind again? The wealth that makes the gods ruins men. My good lord, blessed only to later be cursed, rich only to later be poor, your great fortune was built upon your greatest weaknesses. Oh what a kind man! He's cast out mad from this group of monsters, with nothing to live on at all and no way to make more money. I'll follow and ask about him. I'll always serve him as well as I can. As long as I have any wealth, I'll be by his side."
