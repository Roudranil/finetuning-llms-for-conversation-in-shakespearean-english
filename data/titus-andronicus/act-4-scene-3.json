You, cousins, will go around the ocean and cast your nets; perhaps you can catch her in the sea. But theres just as little justice there as on landso never mind. No, Publius and Sempronius, you must do it; dig with a fork and spade until you get to the center of the Earth. Then, when you get to Plutos underworld, give him this petition. Tell him I ask for justice and for help, and that it comes from old Andronicus, who suffers in ungrateful Rome. Oh, Rome! Well, I made you miserable when I threw the peoples votes on the tyrant Saturninus. Go, go away; and be careful everyone, and don't let a ship get by without searching it. This wicked emperor may have had her shipped her away. And then, kinsmen, we're searching for justice in vain."
