I kneel down here and swear it: if I ever betrayed his love, either by some actual deed or even by just thinking about doing something; if my eyes, ears, or anything else ever delighted in any other man; if I never really loved him or don't love him now, or won't continue to love him dearly (even as he tries to divorce me), then may I lose all comforts! Unkindness is powerfuland his unkindness could kill mebut it can never change my love for him. I cannot say \"whore.\" The word catches in my throat even as I try to say it now. Not all the pleasures in the world could make me do the act that would earn me that name."
