Their lips were touching, like four red roses on a stalk. And a prayer book lay on their pillow,\" said Forrest, \"which almost made me change my mind. But oh, the devil\" And there the villain stopped talking, and Dighton continued the tale: \"We smothered the most perfect, sweet work that nature ever created.\" Both men were crushed with remorse, so that they couldn't speak any more. I left them both to bring this news to the bloody king."
