Fathers have impulsively slaughtered their own sons. Sons have been compelled to butcher their fathers. All this divided York and Lancaster even more, when they were already ominously divided. Oh, but now let Richmond and Elizabeththe true heirs of each royal housebe joined together in holy marriage! And if God wills it, let their heirs enrich the future with peace, plenty, and beautiful, prosperous days! Gracious God, may you blunt the sharpness of traitors' swords and anyone who would bring back these violent days to make poor England weep tears of blood! If any would try to wound this land's fair peace with treason, then don't let them live to enjoy its prosperity. Now civil wounds are bandaged and can heal, and peace lives again. Long may she live here. Let God say amen!"
