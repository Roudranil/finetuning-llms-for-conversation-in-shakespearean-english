On me, who limps along, deformed like this? I'd bet my dukedom on a beggar's penny that I've been wrong about myself all this time! Upon my life, she finds me to be a proper, handsome manthough I can't see it. I should buy a mirror and employ twenty or so tailors to study the current fashions and dress me up.
