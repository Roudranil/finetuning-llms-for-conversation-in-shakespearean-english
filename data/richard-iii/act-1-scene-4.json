Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes    Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept    as 'twere in scorn of eyes   reflecting gems,    That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep    And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.

I seemed to see a thousand shipwrecks; ten thousand men whose bodies had been gnawed by fish; bars of gold; huge anchors; heaps of pearls; and vast amounts of priceless jewels, all scattered on the bottom of the sea. Some of the jewels lay inside of dead men's skulls. And they had crept into their empty eye socketsso that they looked like false eyes.
