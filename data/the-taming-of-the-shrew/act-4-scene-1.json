My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,    And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged,    For then she never looks upon her lure.    Another way I have to man my haggard,    To make her come and know her keepers call.    That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites    That bate and beat and will not be obedient.    She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.    Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.    As with the meat, some undeserv\u00e8d fault    Ill find about the making of the bed,    And here Ill fling the pillow, there the bolster,    This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.    Ay, and amid this hurly I intend    That all is done in reverend care of her.    And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night,    And if she chance to nod Ill rail and brawl,    And with the clamor keep her still awake.    This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,    And thus Ill curb her mad and headstrong humor.    He that knows better how to tame a shrew,    Now let him speak; tis charity to show.   ",
            "translated": "I've begun my reign in this cunning way, and I hope to end up successful. My falcon is now hungry and unfed, and she won't be allowed to eat until she submits to my authority. Otherwise she'll just ignore my bait. And I also have another plan to tame my wild hawk, to make her come and recognize her owner's callthat is, I'll keep her from sleeping, just like trainers do with falcons that flap and flutter and won't be obedient. She ate no food today, and she'll continue to have none. She got no sleep last night, and she'll get none tonight. Just like I did with the meat, I'll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw around the pillow, the cushion, the blanket, and the sheets. Yes, and I'll pretend that I'm making all this fuss for her sake. The result will be that she'll stay awake all night, and if she starts to nod off, I'll scold and argue and keep her awake with my yelling. This is how to kill a wife with kindness, and in this way I'll curb her wild and headstrong nature. If anyone knows a better way to tame a shrew, let him speak up now. I'd appreciate the help."
