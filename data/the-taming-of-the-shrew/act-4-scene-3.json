Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,    For tis the mind that makes the body rich,    And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,    So honor peereth in the meanest habit.    What, is the jay more precious than the lark    Because his feathers are more beautiful?    Or is the adder better than the eel    Because his painted skin contents the eye?    Oh, no, good Kate. Neither art thou the worse    For this poor furniture and mean array.    If thou accountst it shame, lay it on me,    And therefore frolic! We will hence forthwith    To feast and sport us at thy fathers house.    [To  GRUMIO  ]   Go, call my men, and let us straight to him,    And bring our horses unto Long Lane end.    There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.    Lets see, I think tis now some seven o'clock,    And well we may come there by dinnertime.   ",

It's the mind that makes the body rich, after all, and just as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor can be seen through even the lowliest attire. What, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful? Or is the poisonous snake better than the eel because his patterned scales please the eye? Certainly not, good Kate. Therefore you aren't any less precious because of your poor clothes and lowly attire. If you consider it shameful, then lay the shame on me. So cheer up! We will go now to feast and party at your father's house."
