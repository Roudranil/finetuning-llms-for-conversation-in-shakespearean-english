Her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs,    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,    Her traces of the smallest spiders web,    Her collars of the moonshines watery beams,    Her whip of crickets bone, the lash of film,    Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,    Not half so big as a round little worm    Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,    Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers.    And in this state she gallops night by night    Through lovers brains, and then they dream of love;    On courtiers knees, that dream on curtsies straight;    Oer lawyers fingers, who straight dream on fees;    Oer ladies lips, who straight on kisses dream,    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.    Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose,    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pigs tail    Tickling a parsons nose as he lies asleep,    Then he dreams of another benefice.    Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck,    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,    Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two    And sleeps again.   This is that very Mab    That plaits the manes of horses in the night    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,    That presses them and learns them first to bear,    Making them women of good carriage.    This is she   ",

She rides her carriage, which is pulled by tiny little creatures, over mens noses as they lie sleeping. The wheel spokes of her carriage are made of spiders legs; its cover is made of grasshopper wings; and its harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The horse collars are made from moonbeams, while her whip is a single cobweb attached to a cricket bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny gnat wearing a gray coat that is not even half as large as a little round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy young girl.\u00a0Her carriage is an empty hazelnut, made by a squirrel and an old worm, which have been the fairies carriage-builders for countless years.\u00a0 With this magnificent carriage she rides each night through the brains of lovers, who then dream about love. She rides across courtiers knees, who then dream about bowing and curtsying. She rides over lawyers fingers, who then dream about their fees. She rides over ladies lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. But Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells of candy, which angers her. Sometimes she rides over a courtiers nose, and he dreams of sniffing out a way to make some money. Sometimes she tickles a priests nose with the tail of pig given as a tithe to the church, and he dreams of getting a high-paid church position. Sometimes she drives over a soldiers neck, and he dreams of cutting the throats of foreigners, of breaking through fortifications, of ambushes, of the finest-quality Spanish swords, and of huge mugs of alcohol before suddenly waking, frightened, by the sound of drums in his ears. Then he says a prayer or two and goes back to sleep. Mab is the one who tangles the hair of horses manes at night and then hardens the tangles in the foul, dirty hairs; tangles which, if you undo them, bring bad luck. Mab is the hag who gives dreams of sex to virgins and teaches them how to bear the weight of a lover and to bear a child. Shes the one"
