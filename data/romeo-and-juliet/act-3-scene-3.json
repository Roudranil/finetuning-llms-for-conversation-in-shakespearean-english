Wilt thou slay thyself,    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives    By doing damn\u00e8d hate upon thyself?    Why railst thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet    In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,    Which, like a usurer, aboundst in all    And usest none in that true use indeed    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,    Digressing from the valor of a man;    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,    Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,    Like powder in a skill-less soldiers flask,    Is set afire by thine own ignorance;    And thou dismembered with thine own defence.

By my holy order, I swear I thought you were stronger and more stable than this. Have you killed Tybalt? Will you kill yourself, and in performing such a sin also kill your wife, who shares your life? Why are you ranting about your birth, the heavens, and the earth? You are made of the joining of all three, and now want nothing to do with them? You bring shame to your body, your love, and your mind. You are blessed with all three, but like a moneylender you do not use your body, love, or mind for their true purpose. Without honor or nobility, your body is just a wax figure. The love that you swore is just a hollow lie, since you now threaten to kill the love that you vowed to cherish. Your mind, that key to both your body and your love, has failed to handle both of them. Youre like an unskilled soldier who accidentally explodes his own gunpowder because he does not know how to use it: you end up killing yourself with the very thing meant to protect you. Now get a hold of yourself, man! Your Juliet is alive (for whose sake you were just threatening to kill yourself). That is something to be happy about. Tybalt tried to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. That is something to be happy about. The law that promised death for you was mercifully changed into exileanother thing to be happy about. You have been blessed multiple times, and are surrounded by brightest happiness. But like a misbehaved and sullen girl, youre pouting about your bad luck and thwarted love. Now listen to me: those who act the way you are acting now die miserable. Go, be with your love, as we planned. Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her. But make sure to leave before the watchmen take their positions, because they will stop you before you can escape to Mantua. Youll live in Mantua until we can announce your marriage publicly, make peace between your families, and beg the Prince to pardon you. Then well welcome you back with twenty thousand times more joy than youll feel when leaving. Nurse, go to Juliet before Romeo follows. Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in her house to bed. It's likely that their sorrow will make them want to go to sleep, anyway. Romeo is coming."
