            "translated": "Now Romeo's old desire for Rosaline lies in its deathbed, and a new love is ready to be its heir. Romeo used to groan and swear he would die for Rosaline's love, but now he finds Rosaline's beauty nothing in comparison to tender Juliet's. Now someone loves Romeo and Romeo loves someone, and they are both charmed by each other's looks. But Romeo must declare his love to someone who is supposed to be his enemy, and Juliet is love-struck, adoring someone she is supposed to fear. Because he is considered an enemy, Romeo is not allowed to see Juliet, and make the sorts of oaths that lovers usually swear to each other. And Julietjust as much in love with Romeo as he is with hershe has even fewer means of meeting her beloved Romeo. But passion gives them the power, and time gives them the opportunity, to meet each other, tempering their extreme adversity with extreme sweetness.\n"
