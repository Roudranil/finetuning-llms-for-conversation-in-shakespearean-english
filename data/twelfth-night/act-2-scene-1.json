You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of.   He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!

My name is Sebastian, though I called myself Roderigo. My father was Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you've heard of. He is dead now, but he left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born the same hour as me. If only God had allowed us to die in the same hour as well! But you, sir, kept that from happening, for my sister drowned an hour before you pulled me from the breaking waves."
