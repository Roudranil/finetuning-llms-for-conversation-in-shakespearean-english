O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,    That breathes upon a bank of violets,    Stealing and giving odor.   Enough, no more.    'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.    O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,    That, notwithstanding thy capacity    Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,    Of what validity and pitch soe'er,    But falls into abatement and low price    Even in a minute.   So full of shapes is fancy    That it alone is high fantastical.   ",

Play that part againit sounded melancholy. Oh, it sounded to me like a sweet breeze blowing over a bank of violets, stealing their scent and distributing it to everyone. That's enough now, no more music. It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before. Oh spirit of love, how restless you are! You make me want to accept everything, like the sea does, but then the next minute everything seems worthless, no matter how valuable it is. Love is like a hallucinationnothing else is so imaginative and extravagant."
