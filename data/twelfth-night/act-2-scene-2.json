She made good view of me, indeed so much    That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,    For she did speak in starts distractedly.    She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion    Invites me in this churlish messenger.    None of my lords ring? Why, he sent her none.    I am the man.   If it be so, as tis,    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.    Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness,    Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.    How easy is it for the proper false    In womens waxen hearts to set their forms!    Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,    For such as we are made of, such we be.    How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,    And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,    And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.    What will become of this? As I am man,    My state is desperate for my masters love.    As I am woman, now, alas the day,    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!    O time, thou must untangle this, not I.

She did look intently at me, indeed so much that I thought her eyes had caused her to lose her tongue, for she spoke wildly and distractedly. I think she loves me! She is crafty in her passion, and has used this rude messenger to subtly invite me back. So she doesn't want my lord's ring? Well, he never sent her one. I am the man she wants. If this is true, which it is, then the poor lady would be better off loving a dream. I now see that disguises are a tool to aid the resourceful devil. How easy it is for attractive, deceitful men to mold women's hearts to their will! Alas, it's our female frailty that's to blamewe can't help it. We turn out the way we're made. But how will all this play out? My master loves her dearly, and I, poor androgynous fool, love him just as much. And now she, mistaking me for a man, seems to have fallen in love with me. What will become of all this? In my disguise as a man, I have no hope of winning Orsino's love, but as I am really a woman, Olivia's love for me is hopeless too! Oh time, you must untangle this messI can't do it myself. It is too hard a knot for me to untie!"
