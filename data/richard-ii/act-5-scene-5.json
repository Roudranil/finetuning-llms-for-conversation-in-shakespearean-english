My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,    My soul the father; and these two beget    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,    And these same thoughts people this little world,    In humours like the people of this world,    For no thought is contented.   The better sort,    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd    With scruples and do set the word itself    Against the word:    As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,    'It is as hard to come as for a camel    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot    Unlikely wonders;   how these vain weak nails    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,    Nor shall not be the last;   like silly beggars    Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,    That many have and others must sit there;    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back    Of such as have before endured the like.    Thus play I in one person many people,    And none contented:   sometimes am I king;    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,    And so I am:   then crushing penury    Persuades me I was better when a king;    Then am I king'd again: and by and by    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,    And straight am nothing:   but whate'er I be,    Nor I nor any man that but man is    With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased    With being nothing.   Music do I hear?   ",
            "translated": "I've been thinking how I might compare my prison to the world: but because the world is full of people and here there's no one but me, I can't do it. But I'll give it a try. My brain will be the mother and my soul will be the father, and together they'll produce a generation of children, my thoughts. Those thoughts will populate this little worldthey'll have moods just like people in the real world, none of them satisfied. The better sort of thoughts, thoughts of heaven, have too many doubts and make me read the Bible against itself: for example, \"Come, little one\" versus \"It is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the eye of a small needle.\" Ambitious thoughts dwell on ways to escape, like tearing a passage through my rough prison walls with my weak fingernailsand since, there's no hope of escape, die before they have the chance to go any further. Happier thoughts flatter themselves that they aren't the first people to be unlucky, and won't be the last: like beggars sitting in the stocks who tell themselves that many have and other will be in the same place, and in that thought find a kind of comfort, imagining others who have endured the same misfortunes. So I, in one person, play many peoplenone happy. Sometimes I'm a king; then treason makes me wish to be a beggar (and so I am); then crushing suffering persuades me that it was better when I was a king; then I'm king again, but soon remember that Bolingbroke has taken my throne, and I am nothing at all. But whatever I am, neither I nor anyone will pleased with anything, unless he's happy with being nothing. Is this music that I'm hearing?"

I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;    For now hath time made me his numbering clock:    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is    Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,    Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans    Show minutes, times, and hours:   but my time    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,    While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.    This music mads me; let it sound no more;    For though it have helped madmen to their wits,    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.   ",

I wasted time, and now time wastes me. \u00a0For now time itself could tell the time by me: my thoughts are minutes, my eyes are the face of the clock, and the finger that wipes the tears from them is the hand that tells us the time. My groans are like the chimes that ring on the hour; so my sighs and tears and groans show minutes, times, and hours, like a clock. But actually, Bolingbroke is in charge of my time; I'm just his Jack of the clock. The music will make me go mad; stop it now. For though it's helped madmen to be sane again, it seems it will make sane men mad. And yet I bless the person who plays the music, since that's a sign of love; and not many people in this hateful world love me.\u00a0"
