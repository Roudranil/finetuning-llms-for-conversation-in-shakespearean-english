the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-3.json-line-4,"As many good mornings to yourself, worthy lady. According to your ladyship's command, I was supposed to come this early to find out what service you'd like me to carry out. ","   O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman    Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not    Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:    Thou art not ignorant what dear good will    I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,    Nor how my father would enforce me marry    Vain Turio, whom my very soul abhors.    Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say    No grief did ever come so near thy heart    As when thy lady and thy true love died,    Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.    Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,    To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;    And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,    I do desire thy worthy company,    Upon whose faith and honour I repose.    Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,    But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,    And on the justice of my flying hence,    To keep me from a most unholy match,    Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.    I do desire thee, even from a heart    As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,    To bear me company and go with me:    If not, to hide what I have said to thee,    That I may venture to depart alone.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-3.json-line-5,"Oh, Eglamour, you are a gentleman. Don't think that I'm flattering you; I swear I'm not. You are brave, wise, compassionate, well-accomplished. You know how much I care about the banished Valentine, and how my father wants to force me to marry the foolish Turio, whom I hate with all my heart. You have been in love. And I have heard you say that you have never felt more grief in your heart than you did when your ladyyour true lovedied. And you have vowed pure chastity on her grave. Sir Eglamour, I want to go to Valentine in Mantua, where I heard he is. And since the journey is dangerous, I would like your worthy company, because I rely on your faith and honor. Don't encourage my father's anger, Eglamour. Just think about my griefa lady's griefand about the justice of my running away from here; and from a most unholy marriagewhich heaven and fortune would always make horrible. This is coming from a heart as full of sorrows as the sea is full of sand. I want you to keep me company and go with me. If you won't then keep secret what I have said to you so that I may go alone.","   Madam, I pity much your grievances;    Which since I know they virtuously are placed,    I give consent to go along with you,    Recking as little what betideth me    As much I wish all good befortune you.    When will you go?   "

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-0,"When a master's servant behaves like a dog to him, it is tough. I brought this one up from a puppy; I saved this one from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters drowned. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, ""I would teach a dog like this."" I was sent to deliver him as a present from my master to Mistress Silvia, and as soon as I came into the dining room, he comes to her plate and steals her chicken leg. Oh, it's a horrible thing when a dog can't behave himself in different kinds of company! But, as they really should say, I happen to have a dog that is a dog indeeda dog in everything he does. If I didn't have more wisdom than he doesto plead guilty for his wrongdoingI really think he would have been hanged for it. For as sure as I live, he's suffered for it, as you'll see. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanly dogs under the Duke's table. He had not been there (pardon my language) as long as the time it takes to pissand everybody in the room smelled him. ""Out with the dog!"" someone says. ""What dog is that?"" someone else says. ""Whip him!"" a third says. ""Hang him up"" says the Duke. Since I have known the smell before, I knew it was Crab. So I go to the man that whips the dogs: ""Friend,"" I say, ""are you going to whip the dog?"" ""Yes, I am"" he says. ""You'll make things even worse for him if you do,"" I say. ""I was the one who did the thing you know about."" He makes no more fuss about it, but whips me out of the room. How many masters would do this for their servants? No, I swear, I have sat in the stocks for sausages he has stolen. Otherwise, he would have been executed. I have also been punished for geese he has killed. Otherwise, he would have suffered for it. Don't think about this now. No, I remember the trick you played on me when I left Madam Silvia. Didn't I ask you to always pay attention to me, just like I pay attention to you? When did you see me raise up my leg and urinate onto a gentlewoman's skirt? Have you ever seen me do such a trick?",  Sebastian is thy name? I like thee wellAnd will employ thee in some service presently.  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-1,"[To JULIA] Is your name Sebastian? I like you, and so I'll give you a job to do soon.",  In what you please: I'll do what I can.

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-4,[To LANCE] What's this? You bastard peasant! Where have you been these past two days? ,"  Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.  "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-5,"I carried the dog to Mistress Silvia like you asked me to, sir. ",  And what says she to my little jewel?  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-6,And what does she say to my pretty little dog?,"  Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells youcurrish thanks is good enough for such a present.  "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-7,"She says that your dog is badly-behaved. And she tells you that a snide ""thanks"" is good enough for a present like that.",  But she received my dog?  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-8,But did she receive my dog?,"  No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought himback again.  "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-9,"No, she didn't. I have brought him back here again.","  What, didst thou offer her this from me?  "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-10,Wait a second! Did you offer her this dog from me?,"   Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by    the hangman boys in the market-place:   and then I    offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of    yours,   and therefore the gift the greater.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-11,"Yes, sir. Some mischievous boys in the market square stole the other small dog from me. So then I offered her my own dog, who is as big as ten of yours. And therefore the gift was all the greater. ","   Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,    Or ne'er return again into my sight.    Away, I say! Stay'st thou to vex me here?   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-12,"Get out of here and go find my dog! And if you don't, I don't ever want to see you again. Go away, I say! Are you staying here to make me angry?","   A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!    Sebastian, I have entertained thee,    Partly that I have need of such a youth    That can with some discretion do my business,    For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,    But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,    Which, if my augury deceive me not,    Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:    Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.    Go presently and take this ring with thee,    Deliver it to Madam Silvia:    She loved me well deliver'd it to me.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-13,"He is a rascal that continuously makes me ashamed! Sebastian, I have taken you into service, partly because I need such a young boy who can carry out my business with discretion. There's no point in trusting that foolish man over there. But I have mostly employed you because of your face and your manners, whichif my prediction is correctare evidence of a good upbringing, fortune, and truth. Therefore, you should know that I have taken you for these reasons. Go at once and take this ring with you. Deliver it to Madam Silvia. The girl who gave it to me loved me well.","  It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.She is dead, belike?  "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-14,"It seems that you didn't love her, since you parted with her token. Is she dead?",  Not so; I think she lives.  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-15,"No, I think she is alive.",  Alas!  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-16,Ah!,  Why dost thou cry 'alas'?  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-17,"Why do you cry, ""Ah?""",  I cannot chooseBut pity her.  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-18,I can't help myself: I feel sorry for her.,  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-19,Why should you feel sorry for her?,   Because methinks that she loved you as well    As you do love your lady Silvia:    She dreams of him that has forgot her love;    You dote on her that cares not for your love.    'Tis pity love should be so contrary;    And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'   
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-20,"Because I think that she loved you as well as you love your lady Silvia. She dreams of the man who has forgotten her love. You are obsessed with someone who doesn't care to have your love. It's a pity that love should be so contrary. And thinking of it makes me cry, ""Ah!""","   Well, give her that ring and therewithal    This letter. That's her chamber.   Tell my lady    I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.    Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,    Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-21,"Well, give her that ring, and with it, this letter. That's her room there. Tell my lady that she should keep her promise and give me her heavenly picture. Once you deliver the message, go home to my room, where you will find me sad and alone.","   How many women would do such a message?    Alas, poor Proteus! Thou hast entertain'd    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.    Alas, poor fool! Why do I pity him    That with his very heart despiseth me?    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;    Because I love him I must pity him.    This ring I gave him when he parted from me,    To bind him to remember my good will;    And now am I, unhappy messenger,    To plead for that which I would not obtain,    To carry that which I would have refused,    To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.    I am my master's true-confirmed love;    But cannot be true servant to my master,    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-22,"How many women would carry such a message? Ah, poor Proteus! You have employed a fox to be the shepherd of your lambs. Oh, I am a poor fool! Why do I pity the man who hates me with his heart? Because he loves her, he hates me.  And because I love him, I have to feel sorry for him. I gave him this ring when we said goodbyeto make him promise to remember me. And now I am an unhappy messenger, who has to ask for the picture that I don't want to get; to carry the ring which I should have refused; to praise his faithwhich I should have said bad things about. I am my master's truly-confirmed love. But I cannot be a true servant to my master, unless I betray myself. Yes, I will woo Silvia for him. But I'll do it coldly since I don't want him to succeed, as heaven knows. ","  Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my meanTo bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.  "

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-42,She probably thinks that Proteus has abandoned her.,  I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-44,Isn't she beautiful?,"   She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:    When she did think my master loved her well,    She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:    But since she did neglect her looking-glass    And threw her sun-expelling mask away,    The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks    And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,    That now she is become as black as I.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-45,"She has been more beautiful than she is now, madam. When she thought that my master loved her, I think she was as beautiful as you. But since she stopped looking in the mirror and threw her mask away, the air has starved the rosy blush on her cheeks, and eroded the lily-white color of her face, so now she has become as black as I. ",  How tall was she?  
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-46,How tall was she?,"   About my stature; for at Pentecost,    When all our pageants of delight were play'd,    Our youth got me to play the woman's part,    And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,    Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,    As if the garment had been made for me:    Therefore I know she is about my height.    And at that time I made her weep agood,    For I did play a lamentable part:    Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning    For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;    Which I so lively acted with my tears    That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,    Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead    If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-47,"About my height, because at Pentecost, when all our enjoyable plays are performed, I played the woman's part. And I dressed up in Madam Julia's dress, which fitted me as well as my men's clothes, as if the dress was made for me. Therefore, I know she is about my height. And, at that time, I made her cry in earnest because I played a tragic role. It was Ariadne's passionate sorrowing for Theseus not keeping his promise and unjustly running away, madam. I was so convincing with my acting, and even shed tears. Because of this, my poor mistressmoved by it allcried bitterly. If I didn't feel her sorrow in that moment, I should have been dead!","   She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.    Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!    I weep myself to think upon thy words.    Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this    For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.    Farewell.   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-4-scene-4.json-line-48,"She is indebted to you, gentle boy. Ah, poor lady, abandoned and left behind! I cry just thinking about your words. Here, boy, take my purse. I give you this for the sake of your sweet mistress, because you love her. Goodbye. ","   And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.    A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful    I hope my master's suit will be but cold,    Since she respects my mistress' love so much.    Alas, how love can trifle with itself!    Here is her picture: let me see; I think,    If I had such a tire, this face of mine    Were full as lovely as is this of hers:    And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,    Unless I flatter with myself too much.    Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:    If that be all the difference in his love,    I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.    Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:    Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.    What should it be that he respects in her    But I can make respective in myself,    If this fond Love were not a blinded god?    Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,    For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,    Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!    And, were there sense in his idolatry,    My substance should be statue in thy stead.    I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,    That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,    I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes    To make my master out of love with thee!   "
the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-5-scene-1.json-line-0,The sun begins to tinge the western sky with gold. And now it's time for Silva to meet me at Friar Patrick's place. She won't be late.

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-5-scene-2.json-line-2,What? Is it because my legs are too long?,  No; that it is too little.

the-two-gentlemen-of-verona-act-5-scene-2.json-line-10,[To herself] That's true. Such pearls make ladies' eyes useless. I would rather shut my eyes than look at them.,  How likes she my discourse?

Besides, she was planning on going to confession tonight at Patrick's place, but she wasn't there. All of these instances confirm that she has run away. Therefore, please, don't delay by talking.
