Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,    Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets    And made Veronas ancient Citizens    Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments,    To wield old partisans in hands as old,    Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.    If ever you disturb our streets again,    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.    For this time, all the rest depart away.    You, Capulet, shall go along with me,    And, Montague, come you this afternoon    To know our farther pleasure in this case,    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.

Tell me, nephew. Were you around when the fight began?","   Here were the servants of your adversary,    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.    I drew to part them.   In the instant came    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,    He swung about his head and cut the winds,    Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,    Came more and more and fought on part and part,    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-52,"Your servants were fighting Capulet's servants when I arrived. I drew my sword to try to stop them. Just then, the reckless Tybalt showed up with his sword drawn. He taunted me while swinging his sword through the air, which made a hissing sound. As we fought, more and more Capulets and Montagues showed up to join the battle. Finally, the Prince came and stopped the fighting.","  Oh, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?Right glad I am he was not at this fray.  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-53,"Oh, wheres Romeo? Have you seen him at all today? Im happy he wasnt around for this fight.","   Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun    Peered forth the golden window of the east,    A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore    That westward rooteth from this city side,    So early walking did I see your son.    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me    And stole into the covert of the wood.    I, measuring his affections by my own,    Which then most sought where most might not be found,    Being one too many by my weary self,    Pursued my humor not pursuing his,    And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-54,"Madam, my mind was troubled this morning, so an hour before dawn I went out for a walk. As I walked, I saw your son beneath the sycamore grove that grows near the western edge of the city. I walked toward him, but he noticed me and ran and hid in the woods. I assumed that he must be feeling the same way I was, and was looking for a place where he wouldn't be found. So I continued on, following my own inclination to not pursue Romeo and ask him what was on his mind. I was happy to leave Romeo alone as he fled from me. Besides, I was feeling so weary of company that even being with myself was being with one too many people.","   Many a morning hath he there been seen,    With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun    Should in the farthest east begin to draw    The shady curtains from Auroras bed,    Away from light steals home my heavy son,    And private in his chamber pens himself,    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,    And makes himself an artificial night.    Black and portentous must this humor prove    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-55,"Hes been seen at that spot on many mornings, his tears adding to the morning dew and his deep sighs thickening the clouds in the sky. Then, as soon as the happy sun begins to dawn, my unhappy son comes home in order to hide from the light. He keeps to himself in his bedroom, shutting his windows to keep out the daylight so that he can sit in an artificial night. His bad mood is likely to have a bad result, unless someone can give him good advice and remove the cause of his sadness. ","  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-56,"My noble uncle, do you know whats causing his mood?",  I neither know it nor can learn of him.  
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-57,I dont know. And he refuses to tell me.,  Have you importuned him by any means?  
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-58,Have you done everything possible to get him to explain?,"   Both by myself and many other friends.    But he, his own affections counselor,    Is to himselfI will not say how true,    But to himself so secret and so close,    So far from sounding and discovery,    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,    Or dedicate his beauty to the same.    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.    We would as willingly give cure as know.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-59,"I and many of our friends have tried to speak with him. But he insists on sharing his thoughts only with himself, though I dont know how good the advice is that hes giving himself. He keeps his secrets so completely that hes like a flower bud that cant open to the air or sun, because its been poisoned from within by the bite of a worm. If we could just find out the cause of his sadness, wed try to help him as eagerly as we have tried to figure out why he feels sad.","  See, where he comes. So please you, step aside.Ill know his grievance or be much denied.  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-60,"Here he comes. If you don't mind, please leave us alone. Ill make him either tell me whats wrong, or else he'll just decline to tell me over and over again.","  I would thou wert so happy by thy stayTo hear true shrift.Come, madam, lets away.  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-61,"I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story. Come on, madam, lets go.","  Good morrow, cousin.  "

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-63,Is it still that early?,  But new struck nine.  
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-64,The clock has just barely struck nine.,  Ay me! Sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?  
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-65,"Oh, my! Time goes by slowly when youre sad. Was that my father who just rushed away?",  It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?  
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-66,It was. What sadness is making Romeo's hours so long?,"  Not having that which, having, makes them short.  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-67,Lacking the thing which would make the hours short if I had it.,  In love?

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-71,I am in love. But the one I love does not love me back.,"  Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-72,"Oh, it is sad how love, which in theory seems like such a gentle thing, should in actual experience be so rough!","   Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!    Where shall we dine?   O me! What fray was here?    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.    Heres much to do with hate but more with love.    Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,    O anything of nothing first created!    O heavy lightness, serious vanity,    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.    Dost thou not laugh?   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-73,"How can love, which is supposed to be blind, force you to be able to do what it wants? Where should we eat? [Noticing blood] Oh my goodness, what fighting happened here? No, dont tell me. I already know: it was something that had a lot to do with hate, but even more to do with love. Oh, fighting love! Oh, loving hate! Oh, love that originates from nothing! Oh heavy lightness! Serious frivolity! Beautiful shapes smashed together to create an ugly chaos! Love is like heavy feathers, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, waking sleep, the opposite of what it is! Thats the love I feel, since no one loves me in return.

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-76,Because of the way love has oppressed your heart.,"   Why, such is loves transgression.    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it pressed    With more of thine.   This love that thou hast shown    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;    Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.    What is it else? A madness most discreet,    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.    Farewell, my coz.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-77,"Thats how it it goes with love. My own sadness is a heavy weight on my chest, and now youre going to add your own sadness to mine. The love you are showing me is only increasing my grief. Love is like a smoke made out of the sighs of lovers. When the smoke clears, love is a fire burning in the lovers' eyes. But if that love is thwarted, then it is a sea made out of lovers' tears. What else is love? A wise madness. A sweet candy that makes you choke. Goodbye, my cousin.","  Soft!

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-80,"Tell me, seriously, who is the one you love?","  What, shall I groan and tell thee?  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-81,What? Should I cry out the name in a groan of sadness?,"  Groan! Why, no. But sadly, tell me who.  "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-82,"Groan?! Why, of course not. Just tell me who it is.","  A sick man in sadness makes his will,A word ill urged to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.  "

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-87,"Well, now you missed the target. She wont be hit by Cupids arrow. Shes like Diana, protected by the armor of chastity. She is immune to the weak and childish arrows of love. She ignores words of love, refuses to even let you look at her with loving eyes, or open her lap to receive golden gifts that would even tempt a saint. Oh, shes rich in beauty. But shes also poor, because when she dies her beauty will die along with her.",  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,    To merit bliss by making me despair.    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-89,"She has, and in doing so she wastes her beauty, because by living in chastity she ensures that she will never pass her beauty on to her children. Shes too beautiful, and too smart, to be allowed to gain entrance to Heaven by making me despair.

These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,    Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.    He that is strucken blind cannot forget    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.    Show me a mistress that is passing fair;    What doth her beauty serve but as a note    Where I may read who passed that passing fair?    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-1.json-line-93,"Such comparisons will only make her own beauty more obvious. It will be like the masks that pretty girls wear to hide their faces. When they hide their beauty, they make us think of it more. A blind man cant forget the precious eyesight he lost. Show me any beautiful girl. What good is her beauty, other than a reminder of  a girl who is even more beautiful? Goodbye. You cant teach me to forget.",  I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.

And sometime comes she with a tithe-pigs tail    Tickling a parsons nose as he lies asleep,    Then he dreams of another benefice.    Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck,    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,    Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two    And sleeps again.   This is that very Mab    That plaits the manes of horses in the night    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.

romeo-and-juliet-act-1-scene-4.json-line-24,"Shes the fairies midwife, and is no bigger than the stone on the ring of a city councilman. She rides her carriage, which is pulled by tiny little creatures, over mens noses as they lie sleeping. The wheel spokes of her carriage are made of spiders legs; its cover is made of grasshopper wings; and its harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The horse collars are made from moonbeams, while her whip is a single cobweb attached to a cricket bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny gnat wearing a gray coat that is not even half as large as a little round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy young girl. Her carriage is an empty hazelnut, made by a squirrel and an old worm, which have been the fairies carriage-builders for countless years.  With this magnificent carriage she rides each night through the brains of lovers, who then dream about love. She rides across courtiers knees, who then dream about bowing and curtsying. She rides over lawyers fingers, who then dream about their fees. She rides over ladies lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. But Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells of candy, which angers her. Sometimes she rides over a courtiers nose, and he dreams of sniffing out a way to make some money. Sometimes she tickles a priests nose with the tail of pig given as a tithe to the church, and he dreams of getting a high-paid church position. Sometimes she drives over a soldiers neck, and he dreams of cutting the throats of foreigners, of breaking through fortifications, of ambushes, of the finest-quality Spanish swords, and of huge mugs of alcohol before suddenly waking, frightened, by the sound of drums in his ears. Then he says a prayer or two and goes back to sleep. Mab is the one who tangles the hair of horses manes at night and then hardens the tangles in the foul, dirty hairs; tangles which, if you undo them, bring bad luck. Mab is the hag who gives dreams of sex to virgins and teaches them how to bear the weight of a lover and to bear a child. Shes the one","  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talkst of nothing.  "

Some word there was, worser than Tybalts death,    That murdered me. I would forget it fain,    But oh, it presses to my memory,    Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners minds.    Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.    That banishèd, that one word banishèd    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalts death    Was woe enough, if it had ended there.

My husband, whom Tybalt would have killed, is alive. And Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead. This is good news. So why am I crying? Because there was news thats even worse than that of Tybalts death. Worse news that kills me inside. I wish I could forget it, but it forces its way into my memory the way sins obsess guilty minds. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished. That word banished, that single word banished, is worse than the death of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalts death would have been misery enough even if nothing else had happened. Or, if misery loves company, and one grief must necessarily follow another, then it would have been better had the Nurse, after telling me that Tybalt was dead, then told me that my mother or my father, or even both, were gone. That would have pushed me into normal feelings of grief. But to tell me that Tybalts is dead and then say, Romeo has been banished. To say that is the same as saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, are all dead. Romeo has been banished.

Now get a hold of yourself, man! Your Juliet is alive (for whose sake you were just threatening to kill yourself). That is something to be happy about. Tybalt tried to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. That is something to be happy about. The law that promised death for you was mercifully changed into exileanother thing to be happy about.

I do spy a kind of hope,    Which craves as desperate an execution    As that is desperate which we would prevent.

An if thou darest, Ill give thee remedy.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-4-scene-1.json-line-27,"Wait, daughter. I see a ray of hope. But it will require an act as desperate as the situation we want to avoid. If you have the willpower to kill yourself rather than marry Count Paris, then youll likely agree to experience something like death to escape this problem. You can wrestle with death itself in order to escape from death. If you dare to do it, Ill give you the solution.","   O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,    From off the battlements of yonder tower;    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,    Oercovered quite with dead mens rattling bones,    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;    Or bid me go into a new-made grave    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble    And I will do it without fear or doubt,    To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.

All those things make me tremble when I hear them said, but Ill do them without fear or dread in order to be a pure wife to my sweet love.","   Hold, then. Go home, be merry. Give consent    To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.    Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.    Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.

No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade    To wanny ashes, thy eyes windows fall    Like death when he shuts up the day of life.    Each part, deprived of supple government,    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death.    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.    Then, as the manner of our country is,    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.    In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,    And hither shall he come, and he and I    Will watch thy waking, and that very night    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.    And this shall free thee from this present shame,    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,    Abate thy valor in the acting it.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-4-scene-1.json-line-29,"Be strong, then. Go home, be cheerful, and agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Tomorrow night make sure that you go to sleep alone. Dont let the Nurse sleep in your bedroom. [Showing her a vial] Drink this liquor when youre in bed. A cold, sleepy feeling will then run through your veins, and your pulse will cease. Your body will go cold, and youll stop breathing. The red of your lips and cheeks will fade to a pale ashen color, and your eyelids will close just as if you were dead. Your body will lose control over its own movement, and will become stiff as that of a corpse. Youll remain in this simulation of death for forty-two hours, and then youll wake as if from a pleasant sleep. So when the bridegroom comes to wake you from your bed in the morning, he will think that you are dead. Then, as is the tradition of our city, youll be dressed in your best clothes and placed on an uncovered funeral bier, and carried to the Capulet tomb that holds all of your dead relatives. Meanwhile, before you wake up, Ill send word to Romeo of our plan. Hell come here, and well keep a watch over you as you wake. That night, Romeo will take you with him to Mantua. So, as long as you dont change your mind or let your womanly fear interfere with your courage, youll be free from the current situation which threatens to force you into sin. ","  Give me, give me!

","   In faith, I will.Let me peruse this face.    Mercutios kinsman, noble County Paris.    What said my man, when my betossèd soul    Did not attend him as we rode? I think    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.    Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,    To think it was so?   O, give me thy hand,    One writ with me in sour misfortunes book.    Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave.    [ROMEO opens the tomb to reveal JULIET inside]    A grave? Oh, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes    This vault a feasting presence full of light.    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.    [Lays PARIS in the tomb]    How oft when men are at the point of death    Have they been merry, which their keepers call    A lightning before death! Oh, how may I    Call this a lightning?O my love, my wife!    Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.    Thou art not conquered.   Beautys ensign yet    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,    And deaths pale flag is not advancèd there.    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?    O, what more favor can I do to thee,    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain    To sunder his that was thine enemy?    Forgive me, cousin.   Ah, dear Juliet,    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe    That unsubstantial death is amorous,    And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,    And never from this palace of dim night    Depart again. Here, here will I remain    With worms that are thy chamber maids.   Oh, here    Will I set up my everlasting rest,    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars    From this world-wearied flesh.   Eyes, look your last.    Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss    A dateless bargain to engrossing death.    [Kisses JULIET, takes out the poison]    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on    The dashing rocks thy seasick, weary bark.    Heres to my love!   [Drinks the poison]   O true apothecary,    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-5-scene-3.json-line-17,"I promise, I will. Let me look at this face. Its Mercutios relative, noble Count Paris. What did my servant tell me while we were riding here? I was so upset I wasnt paying attention to him. I think he told me Paris was supposed to marry Juliet. Isnt that what he said? Or was I dreaming? Or am I crazy and, hearing him say something about Juliet, I jumped to the wrong conclusion? [Speaking to Paris body] Oh, give me your hand. You and I both had equal measures of bad fortune! Ill bury you in a magnificent grave. [ROMEO opens the tomb to reveal JULIET inside] A grave? No! It is a cupola atop a tower, my dead young man. Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb like a festival chamber full of light. Dead man, lie down right thereanother dead man is burying you. [ROMEO lays PARIS in the tomb] Men are often happy just before their death. Their nurses call it the lightness before death. Oh, how can I call this lightness? Oh, my love, my wife! Though death has sucked the honey from your breath, it has not yet had the power to ruin your beauty. You are not conquered. A beautiful banner of red still lingers on your lips and cheeks. The paleness of death has not yet reached them. Tybalt, are you lying there in your bloody shroud? Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to use the hand that cut short your youth to kill your murderer. Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, why are you still so beautiful? Should I believe that death itself loves you, and that the hungry, hated monster keeps you here in the dark to be his lover? To make sure that doesnt happen, Ill stay with you forever and never again leave this dark tomb. Here, here Ill remain with the worms that are your chamber-maids. Oh, Ill rest here forever and escape the control of the bad fortune that has plagued my body. Eyes, see for the last time! Arms, make your last embrace! And lips, you doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss the infinite deal I have made with death. [ROMEO kisses JULIET and takes out the poison] Come, bitter transport. Come, unpleasant guide!

romeo-and-juliet-act-5-scene-3.json-line-59,Then tell us immediately what you know about all this.,"   I will be brief, for my short date of breath    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,    And she, there dead, that Romeos faithful wife.    I married them, and their stoln marriage day    Was Tybalts doomsday, whose untimely death    Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,    Betrothed and would have married her perforce    To County Paris. Then comes she to me,    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean    To rid her from this second marriage,    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.    Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,    A sleeping potion, which so took effect    As I intended, for it wrought on her    The form of death.    Meantime I writ to Romeo,    That he should hither come as this dire night,    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,    Being the time the potions force should cease.    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,    Was stayed by accident, and yesternight    Returned my letter back. Then all alone    At the prefixèd hour of her waking    Came I to take her from her kindreds vault,    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,    But when I came, some minute ere the time    Of her awakening, here untimely lay    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.    She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,    And bear this work of heaven with patience.    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.    All this I know, and to the marriage    Her Nurse is privy.   And if aught in this    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life    Be sacrificed some hour before his time    Unto the rigor of severest law.   "
romeo-and-juliet-act-5-scene-3.json-line-60,"Ill be brief, because the time I have left to live is not long enough to tell a long story. Romeo, who lies there dead, was Juliets husband. And she, who lies there dead, was Romeos faithful wife. I married them. Their secret wedding day was the same day Tybalt died. His untimely death led to the banishment of the bridegroom. Juliet was distraught not over Tybalts death, but rather over Romeos banishment. To end her grief, you arranged for her to marry Count Paris. At that point she came to me, and, looking wild, threatened to kill herself unless I came up with a plan to help her escape this second marriage. Then I gave her a special sleeping potion that, as I had planned, made it seem as if she had died. Meanwhile, I wrote to Romeo to tell him to come here tonight, this awful night, to help get her out of her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off. But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was stopped by an accident, and returned my letter to me last night. So at the time when Juliet was scheduled to wake up, I came here alone to take her out of her familys tomb. My plan was to hide her in my cell until I could get word to Romeo. But when I arrived, just a few minutes before Juliet awoke, Paris and Romeo were already here, lying dead. She woke up, and I begged her to come out of the tomb with me and bear this work of God with patience. But then a noise frightened me, and I ran from the tomb. She was too desperate to leave with me, and, it seems, she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage. If any of this misfortune is my fault, let me be sacrificed and punished under the strictest law.",  We still have known thee for a holy man. Wheres Romeos man? What can he say in this?
