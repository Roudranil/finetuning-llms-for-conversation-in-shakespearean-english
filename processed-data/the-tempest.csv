Like a good parent who raises a bad child, my trust in him produced the opposite effect, making him into a liar as big as my trust in him wasand my trust in him had no limit. My confidence in him was infinite. Now established in his position of power, and able to use all of my wealth (and whatever wealth he could use my power to take for himself), he became like a man who told a lie for so long that he began to believe it was true.

Antonio asked that the king, in return for his oath of loyalty and however much money he paid to the king each year, would immediately remove me and all of immediate family from Milan, and then give the dukedom to my brother. So then, they raised an army to pull off this treachery.

the-tempest-act-1-scene-2.json-line-34,"Good question, my dear girl. My story does indeed bring up that question. My dear, they didnt dare. Because I was so loved by the people of Milan, Antonio and Alonso had to keep any blood from staining their actions, and hide their evil goals behind a prettier picture. In short, they hurried us onto a ship and carried us a few miles out to sea. There, they had prepared a rotten shell of a boat that had no ropes, equipment, sails, or a mast. Even the rats had abandoned it when they sensed its likelihood to sink.They lowered us down into the water. We were left to cry out to the sea, which just roared back at us.

Sometimes I would divide myself, and burn at many places at once. I burned on the main mast, the yards extending from the mastand, at the same time, split to burn the bowsprit extending from the prow. Then I joined back together to form a single flame.
