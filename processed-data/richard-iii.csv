richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-0,"Now the winter of our troubles has been transformed into glorious summer by the ascension of my brother, King Edward IV, son of the house of York. All the clouds that had descended over our family have now been banished and returned to the sea. Now we wear wreaths of victory on our foreheads, and we've hung up our armor as decoration. We've exchanged the sound of our battle trumpets for the sound of joyful greetings, and our death marches have become stately dances. The grim, warlike expressions on our faces have smoothed. And instead of charging on armored horses to frighten our opponents, we now dance in ladies' chambers to seductive songs on the lute. But as for me, I am not made for such games of love, or to admire myself in a mirror. I was badly made, and I lack the good looks to strut in front of passing girls. Nature has cheated me out of handsome features and proper proportions. I was born deformed, unfinished, and born prematurely. I was barely half-created when I came into the world, and left so lame and misshapen that dogs bark at me as I limp past them. In such delicate times of peace, I have nothing to do. No joys help me pass the time, unless I want to see my own shadow in the sun and make speeches about my deformity. Therefore, since I cannot amuse myself by being a lover during these peaceful days, I am determined to become a villain. I have hatched plots and put dangerous plans into action, using prophecies made while drunk; slander; and stories about dreams in order to set my brother George, Duke of Clarence, against my other brother, the king, so that they hate each other. If King Edward is as true as I am clever, false, and treacherous, then this very day Clarence will be imprisoned because of a prophecy that ""G"" will murder Edward's children. But, you thoughts, hide yourselves deep down in my soul, for here comes Clarence.","  Brother, good day. What means this armèd guardThat waits upon your Grace?  "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,"Good day, brother. Why do you have all these armed guards accompanying you, your Grace?","  His majesty,Tend'ring my persons safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.  "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-2,His Majesty was so concerned for my personal safety that he appointed this escort to conduct me to the Tower.,  Upon what cause?  
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,You're being arrested? For what reason?,  Because my name is George.  
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-4,Because my name is George.,"   Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.    O, belike his majesty hath some intent    That you shall be new christened in the Tower.    But whats the matter, Clarence? May I know?   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,"Alas, my lord, that's no fault of yours. If that's the problem, then our brother, the king, should arrest those who named you instead. Or maybe his Majesty intends to baptize you and rename you in the Tower. But what's the reason for this, Clarence? Will you tell me?","   Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest    As yet I do not.   But, as I can learn,    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,    And from the crossrow plucks the letter ""G"",    And says a wizard told him that by G    His issue disinherited should be.    And for my name of George begins with ""G"",    It follows in his thought that I am he.    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these    Have moved his Highness to commit me now.   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,"Yes, Richard, I'll inform you when I knowbut right now I have no idea. As far as I can tell, the king has been putting a lot of trust in prophecies and dreams lately. And he picked the letter ""G"" from the alphabet, and says that a wizard told him that ""G"" will steal the throne from his children. And my name, George, begins with ""G,"" so he thinks that the prophecy refers to me. Because of this, along with other trivial reasons, his Highness feels compelled to arrest me.","   Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.    'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, tis she    That tempers him to this extremity.    Was it not she and that good man of worship,    Anthony Woodeville, her brother there,    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,    From whence this present day he is delivered?    We are not safe, Clarence. We are not safe.   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,"Well, this is what happens when men are ruled by women. It isn't the king who's sending you to the Towerit's his wife, Lady Elizabeth Grey. She's the one who persuaded him to take such an extreme action. Didn't she and her brother, Anthony Woodeville, make the king send Lord Hastings to the Tower? He was released only today. We are not safe, Clarence. We are not safe.","   By heaven, I think there is no man is secure    But the queens kindred and night-walking heralds    That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.    Heard ye not what an humble suppliant    Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-8,"By heaven, I think the only people who are safe are the queen's relatives, and the secret messengers who travel between the king and his mistress, Jane Shore. Didn't you hear how Lord Hastings had to beg Miss Shore in order to get released?","   Humbly complaining to her deity    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.    Ill tell you what: I think it is our way,    If we will keep in favor with the king,    To be her men and wear her livery.    The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,    Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,    Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-9,"Yes, Lord Hastings gained his liberty by humbly bowing down to that goddess. I'll tell you what: if we want to stay in the king's favor, it would be best if we act like Miss Shore's servants too. Ever since our brother declared that Miss Shore and the queen are nobility, they've become great gossips in the court.","   I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.    His majesty hath straitly given in charge    That no man shall have private conference,    Of what degree soever, with his brother.   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-10,"I beg your pardon, your Graces. His Majesty the king has strictly ordered that no one can speak privately with your brother Clarence, no matter their social rank.","   Even so.

We say the king    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.    We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot,    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,    And that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks.    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-1.json-line-11,"Is that so? If it please your Worship, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say. We're not plotting any treason, man. We say that the king is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen is well advanced in years, beautiful, and not jealous. We say that Mister Shore's wife has pretty feet, cherry lips, lovely eyes, and a pleasant voice. We say that the queen's relatives have all become nobles. What do you say to that, sir? Can you deny any of this?","  With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.  "

Next a shadow like an angel came wandering by, with its bright hair spattered with blood, and it shrieked aloud, ""Clarence is herefalse, fickle, lying Clarence, who stabbed me in the field at Tewkesbury. Seize him, avenging devils. Take him and torture him."" With that it seemed like a legion of foul demons surrounded me and howled in my ears, and their cries were so loud and horrible that I woke up trembling. And for a long time afterward I still believed that I was in hellthat was how terrible an impression this dream made on me.","  No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.

richard-iii-act-1-scene-4.json-line-10,"I will, my lord. May God give you good rest.","   Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,    Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.    Princes have but their titles for their glories,    An outward honor for an inward toil,    And, for unfelt imaginations,    They often feel a world of restless cares,    So that betwixt their titles and low name    There's nothing differs but the outward fame.   "
richard-iii-act-1-scene-4.json-line-11,"Sorrow breaks natural rhythms and interrupts sleep, making night into morning and noon into night.

Its majesty is almost lost in an abyss of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion. To fix this situation, we beg your Grace to take charge and become king of this landnot Lord Protector, steward, substitute, or lowly agent to another ruler, but king, the successor of a noble bloodline. This is your right by birth, your empire, your own. It's for this purpose that I have come with these citizenswho are your devoted and loving friends, and vehemently begged me to do thisto try and convince your Grace to accept our plea.","   I cannot tell if to depart in silence    Or bitterly to speak in your reproof    Best fitteth my degree or your condition.    If not to answer, you might haply think    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,    Which fondly you would here impose on me.    If to reprove you for this suit of yours,    So seasoned with your faithful love to me,    Then on the other side I checked my friends.    Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,    And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,    Definitively thus I answer you:    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert    Unmeritable shuns your high request.    First, if all obstacles were cut away    And that my path were even to the crown    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,    So mighty and so many my defects,    That I would rather hide me from my greatness,    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,    Than in my greatness covet to be hid    And in the vapor of my glory smothered.    But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,    And much I need to help you, were there need.    The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,    Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,    Will well become the seat of majesty,    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.    On him I lay what you would lay on me,    The right and fortune of his happy stars,    Which God defend that I should wring from him.   "
richard-iii-act-3-scene-7.json-line-30,"I can't decide if I should leave in silence or bitterly scold you. I don't know which response is more appropriate to my rank and your social position. If I say nothing, you might think that my silence means consent, and you'll assume that I agree to bear the golden burden of responsibility that you're foolishly trying to impose on me. But if I scold you for this request just after you've proven your faithful love for me, then I would be guilty of rebuking my friends. Therefore I will speak, and so avoid the first possibility, but with my words I will avoid the second. So this is my answer, once and for all: I thank you for your love, but I don't deserve to be king. So I must turn down your noble request. Even if all obstacles were removed and my path led straight to the crownmy proper birthrightmy poverty of spirit and my many other flaws would still make me prefer to hide from my greatness, rather than be swallowed up by it and be smothered in glory. I am only a small boat, unprepared for the stormy sea of kingship. But, thank God, there is no need for me to rule. The royal tree has left us royal fruit, which, with time, will fit the throne well, and make us all happy as our king. I lay on him the responsibility you want to lay on me, as it is his birthright and his happy destiny. God forbid that I should steal the crown from him.","   My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,    All circumstances well considerèd.    You say that Edward is your brothers son;    So say we too, but not by Edwards wife.    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy    Your mother lives a witness to that vow    And afterward by substitute betrothed    To Bona, sister to the king of France.    These both put off, a poor petitioner,    A care-crazed mother to a many sons,    A beauty-waning and distressèd widow,    Even in the afternoon of her best days,    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,    Seduced the pitch and height of his degree    To base declension and loathed bigamy.    By her in his unlawful bed he got    This Edward, whom our manners term the Prince.    More bitterly could I expostulate,    Save that, for reverence to some alive,    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self    This proffered benefit of dignity,    If not to bless us and the land withal,    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry    From the corruption of abusing times    Unto a lineal, true-derivèd course.   "
richard-iii-act-3-scene-7.json-line-31,"My lord, your response shows that you have a strong conscience, but your objections are trivial, especially considering the circumstances. You say that Prince Edward is your brother's son. We agree, but not by your brother's wife. King Edward was first engaged to Lady Lucyand your mother lives as a witness to thisand after that he was betrothed to Lady Bona, the King of France's sister-in-law. But when both these engagements failed, Elizabeth Greya harried mother of many sons, a poor widow losing her former beauty, a woman past her primetook advantage of his lust and seduced him away from his role of majesty. She led him to drop his standards and commit adultery with her. With him she conceived this illegitimate Edward, whom we now politely call ""the Prince."" I could describe even worse things, too, but I'll restrain myself out of respect for some who are still alive. Therefore, my good lord, even if you don't want to bless us and the land with your rule, then at least accept this offered crown to rescue your noble family from its current corruption. Return the line of hereditary kingship to a true, straight course.","  Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.  "
