pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,"I do, Antiochus. But your daughter is so beautiful that I wouldn't mind if I died trying to win the right to marry her.","   Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,    For the embracements even of Jove himself;    At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,    Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,    The senate-house of planets all did sit,    To knit in her their best perfections.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-2,"Bring in my daughter. Put her in a wedding dress good enough for the king of the gods himself. From the time she was conceived to the time she was born, Nature worked to make her beautiful specifically for this moment of marriage, and the whole universe decided to make her as perfect as possible.","   See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,    Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king    Of every virtue gives renown to men!    Her face the book of praises, where is read    Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence    Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath    Could never be her mild companion.    You gods that made me man, and sway in love,    That have inflamed desire in my breast    To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,    Or die in the adventure,   be my helps,    As I am son and servant to your will,    To compass such a boundless happiness!

pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,"Here she comes! She's as young and beautiful as the spring. She's kind to her subjects, and her noble, virtuous thoughts are well-regarded by all. Just the sight of her face makes me happyit's like all sadness and anger evaporate in her presence. The gods that created me gave me the uncontrollable desire to either be with her or die trying.

pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,who has every intention of being your son-in-law,"   Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,    With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;    For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:    Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view    Her countless glory, which desert must gain;    And which, without desert, because thine eye    Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.    Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,    Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,    Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,    That without covering, save yon field of stars,    Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;    And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist    For going on death's net, whom none resist.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,"you see before you a beautiful woman. You can look, but don't touch! She's dangerous. Her beauty might lure you in, but if you're not deserving, you'll be killed just for trying to get a closer look.[He points to a pile of skeletons] Those former princes, like you, were drawn here by the rumors. They were looking for adventure, too. As you can see by their silence (and their bare bones), they're all casualties of love with no grave to speak of, except the stars above. Take a hint from their corpses and turn back now before it's too late.","   Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught    My frail mortality to know itself,    And by those fearful objects to prepare    This body, like to them, to what I must;    For death remember'd should be like a mirror,    Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.    I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do    Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,    Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;    So I bequeath a happy peace to you    And all good men, as every prince should do;    My riches to the earth from whence they came;     [To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]     But my unspotted fire of love to you.    Thus ready for the way of life or death,    I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,"Thanks, Antiochus, for reminding me of my own mortality. Those frightening things are preparing my body, like theirs, for the worst that could happen: death. When we remember death, it should act like a mirror, reflecting back to us the truth that life is short, and that it's a mistake to put our faith in it. I'll make my will, then, like sick men do when they've experienced the world and, near death, are both sad and resigned to give up the joys experienced on earth. I wish the best to you and to all good men (as every prince should do), and give away all my belongings. ","   Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:    Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,    As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.

pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-8,"Since you won't listen to my advice, you'll have to face the consequences: if you read the riddle and can't answer it, you'll be killed like the others before you.","  Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!  "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-9,"Of all the men who've tried, I hope you succeed! I hope this ends well for you!","   Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,    Nor ask advice of any other thought    But faithfulness and courage.    I am no viper, yet I feed    On mother's flesh which did me breed.    I sought a husband, in which labour    I found that kindness in a father:    He's father, son, and husband mild;    I mother, wife, and yet his child.    How they may be, and yet in two,    As you will live, resolve it you.    Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers    That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,    Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,    If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?    Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,    Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:    But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt    For he's no man on whom perfections wait    That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.    You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;    Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,    Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:    But being play'd upon before your time,    Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.    Good sooth, I care not for you.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-10,"Like a knight going into a tournament, the only advice or help I need is faithfulness and courage.[Reading the riddle from a scroll] I'm not a snake, but I eatMy own mother's flesh. When I looked for a husband, I found him in a father. He's father, son, and husband; I'm mother, wife, and child. How is this possible? I leave it up to you.[Looking back up] Oh, that last part is a bitter pill to swallow. Oh, you gods that see everything we do on earth, how can you look down on such a horrible thing (if what I'm reading is true)? [He grabs ANTIOCHUS's DAUGHTER's hand] Beautiful princess, I did love you,  and would still love you, but now I know the dark secret behind that pretty face. I have to tell you: all my plans are unravelling, because a good man could hardly marry into such a depraved situation once he knows what's in store. You're gorgeous and your character makes you even more desirable; under normal circumstances, anyone would be lucky to marry you, and the gods would smile down on it. But you've been violated so young; it's a crime worthy of hell. I'm not interested in you at all.","   Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.    For that's an article within our law,    As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:    Either expound now, or receive your sentence.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-11,"Don't touch her, Prince Pericles, if you value your life. That's the law, and it's as dangerous as the rest. Your time is up! Tell us the answer now, or prepare to die.","   Great king,    Few love to hear the sins they love to act;    'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.    Who has a book of all that monarchs do,    He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:    For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.    Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;    And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,    The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:    To stop the air would hurt them.   The blind mole casts    Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd    By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.    Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;    And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?    It is enough you know; and it is fit,    What being more known grows worse, to smother it.    All love the womb that their first being bred,    Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-12,"Sir, no one likes to hear their sins repeated back to themit would offend you to hear me say it. Anyone who found out about this before probably kept their mouth shut rather than telling. Evil spreads as quickly as dust on the wind. As the dust surrounds us and blinds us, we can no longer tell it's there; we start to think it's normal. The blind mole throws his hills of dirt toward heaven, to tell the gods the earth is filled with man's evil, and the worm dies because of it. The world is full of evil men like you, but kings are supposed to be gods on earth! When kings are corrupt, they can twist the law to conform to their evil desires (and when a god makes a mistake, who would dare to tell him?). You know your actions are wrong, and the fact that you know and still keep on doing it makes it even worse. By the love everyone has for their own mother, please don't kill me for what I've said!","   [Aside]   Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found    the meaning:    But I will gloze with him.      Young prince of Tyre,    Though by the tenor of our strict edict,    Your exposition misinterpreting,    We might proceed to cancel of your days;    Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree    As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:    Forty days longer we do respite you;    If by which time our secret be undone,    This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:    And until then your entertain shall be    As doth befit our honour and your worth.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-13,"[To himself] I wish I had a mind like yours! He's figured out the meaning, but I'll talk him out of it.[To PERICLES] Prince of Tyre: though, according to our law, I could kill you for not giving me a correct answer, I'll give you some more time on account of your noble blood and your way with words. If, in forty days' time, you reveal the secret, I'll welcome you as my son-in-law with a celebratory feast worthy of myself as a king and you as a prince.","   How courtesy would seem to cover sin,    When what is done is like an hypocrite,    The which is good in nothing but in sight!    If it be true that I interpret false,    Then were it certain you were not so bad    As with foul incest to abuse your soul;    Where now you're both a father and a son,    By your untimely claspings with your child,    Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;    And she an eater of her mother's flesh,    By the defiling of her parent's bed;    And both like serpents are, who though they feed    On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.    Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men    Blush not in actions blacker than the night,    Will shun no course to keep them from the light.    One sin, I know, another doth provoke;    Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:    Poison and treason are the hands of sin,    Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:    Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,    By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-14,"You're trying to hide your evil with a show of hospitality, but it's hypocrisy; it only looks good from the outside! If I'd really gotten the answer wrong, then that would mean you weren't dirtying your soul by committing disgusting incest. But now, by sleeping with your daughter, you're both father and son, acting more like a husband than a father . . . and she's filling the role her mother should, taking her mother's place in your bed. They're both like snakes who eat pretty flowers but produce deadly poison.Goodbye, Antioch! I'm smart enough to know that a guy who's comfortable doing one evil thing won't hesitate to do another one if it'll keep him from being found out. One sin leads to another; murder is as close to lust as fire is to smoke. If I stick around, I'll be poisoned, or accused of treason, anything to keep me from exposing him. So, to save myself and not expose him, I'll leave here and escape the danger I'm afraid of.","   He hath found the meaning, for which we mean    To have his head.    He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,    Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin    In such a loathed manner;    And therefore instantly this prince must die:    For by his fall my honour must keep high.    Who attends us there?   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-15,"[To himself] He's figured out the riddle, which means I'll have to kill him. He can't survive another day to ruin my reputation, or to tell the world the hateful sin I've committed. The prince must die instantly for my honor's sake.[To an unknown person] Who's there?",  Doth your highness call?  
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-16,"Did you call, sir?","   Thaliard,    You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes    Her private actions to your secrecy;    And for your faithfulness we will advance you.    Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;    We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:    It fits thee not to ask the reason why,    Because we bid it. Say, is it done?   "
pericles-act-1-scene-1.json-line-17,"Thaliard, you're my trusted servant, and I need you to do something for me under the utmost secrecy. You'll be rewarded for your service.[He pulls out a bottle of poison and a bag of gold] Look, Thaliard, here's poison, and here's gold. I hate Pericles, Prince of Tyre, and I want you to kill him. Don't ask me whyit's because I said so. Understand?","  My lord,'Tis done.  "

pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-0,"[Speaking to Lords outside] Don't let anyone come in here. [To himself] Why am I so changed? Why am I sad, downcast, and melancholy every hour of every day? Neither a beautiful day nor a quiet night (which should be where I put my worries to rest) can give me peace. Even when I'm surrounded by things I should enjoy, I can't get rid of this fear of danger waiting for me at Antiochbut there's no way the king could reach me here! And yet, nothing can cheer me up, not even the reality of distance. That's the way the mind works: once we start worrying about something, it only gets worse and worse, until we convince ourselves that the danger is real. Just like that, my fear of Antiochus, who is a much more powerful king than I amand can put his desires into actionhas been blown out of proportion. Even though I haven't said a word, he'll assume I've told his secret. And it won't help for me to say I'm loyal to him, if he's already decided I'm not. If he's determined to keep his secret under wraps, all he has to do is kill me. He'll infiltrate my country with his armies, wage war, and overthrow the government. He'll punish my subjects, too, even though they never did anything to hurt him. I'm more worried about them than I am about myself; I'm just the treetops that protect the roots by which the people grow, and help defend them. It's concern for them that makes my body sick and my soul tired with wanting to punish Antiochus before he punishes us.",  Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-2,And good luck on your journey!,"   Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.    They do abuse the king that flatter him:    For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;    The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,    To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;    Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,    Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.    When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,    He flatters you, makes war upon your life.    Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;    I cannot be much lower than my knees.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-3,"Quiet, please. Let someone who knows what he's talking about speak up. These men are just flattering you, sir, and flattery only fans the fire of sin. When a king's fault is just a spark, flattery is the blast that gives it heat and makes it glow stronger. On the other hand, wise advice is the best tool a king can make use of, since even kings make mistakes sometimes. When Mr. Yes-man over here wishes you good luck, he's flattering you and, really, threatening your life.[He kneels] Forgive me, sir. Hit me if you want. I can't get much lower than here, on my knees.","  All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlookWhat shipping and what lading's in our haven,And then return to us.

Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,    Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,    I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.    From whence an issue I might propagate,    Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.    Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;    The rest   hark in thine ear   as black as incest:    Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father    Seem'd not to strike, but smooth:     but thou    know'st this,    'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.    Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,    Under the covering of a careful night,    Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,    Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.    I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears    Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:    And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,    That I should open to the listening air    How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,    To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,    To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,    And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:    When all, for mine, if I may call offence,    Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:    Which love to all, of which thyself art one,    Who now reprovest me for it,   "
pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-12,"You sound like a doctor, Helicanus, but what you're prescribing me is something you'd hardly do yourself. You see, I went to Antioch where, as you know, I faced death for the chance to win a famously beautiful woman. I had hoped we would get married and have children together, heirs for my throne that would strengthen my rule in this country and delight my subjects. I thought she was beautiful in person, but listen: they were committing incest. Once I figured it out, her sinful father didn't lash out; he suddenly became very smooth. As you well know, it's time to be afraid when tyrants kiss you. I ran away in the dark of night and, once I got here, thought I was safe. I know Antiochus is a tyrant, and that he's probably getting increasingly paranoid about what I know. And if he suspects that I've told the world how he killed all of those princes, and slept with his own daughter, then there's no doubt that he'll invade our country on the pretense of me having offended him. Then the country will be plunged into war for my socalled offense, and many innocent people will die, and everyone I love, yourself included, will blame me for it","  Alas, sir!

pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-13,"Oh, sir!","   Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,    Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts    How I might stop this tempest ere it came;    And finding little comfort to relieve them,    I thought it princely charity to grieve them.   "
pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-14,"I can't sleep. I'm pale and sick. I can't stop thinking about it, can't stop trying to come up with ways to stop this storm before it happens. And since there's no solution, I'm just letting myself be sad about it.","   Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.    Freely will I speak.

pericles-act-1-scene-2.json-line-15,"Well, sir, since you've given me permission to speak, I will. You're right to be afraid of Antiochus, since he'll either wage a public war or kill you privately. So, I recommend that you get away and don't come back until he either gets over his anger or dies.

Well, now I see that a man would be wise if, being told to ask for whatever he wanted from the king, said he didn't want to know any of the king's secrets. Now I see his reason for it: I mean, if a king tells you to be a villain, you're bound by your promise to him to be one. Quiet!

So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife    Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:    Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;    Here many sink, yet those which see them fall    Have scarce strength left to give them burial.

pericles-act-1-scene-4.json-line-6,"But look what heaven can do! At one time, the earth, sea, and air were hardly enough to content and please our mouths, though they gave us all the food we needed to survive. Just as houses become run-down from lack of use, our mouths are now starved for lack of exercise. Two years ago we looked for the best recipes to please our palates; now we'd be happy to get a crust a bread, and beg for it.

Forgive us for using the same language in all these different places where our scenes are set for the sake of simplicity. Now let me fill you in on what happens next, in the gaps between the parts of our story: Pericles takes to the unruly sea once again, along with many courtiers. He's coming to see his daughter, the light of his life. Old Escanes, Helicanus's friend whom he left in charge, is governing while he's gone. Keep that in mind, since Helicanus is going along with Pericles. With a sturdy ship and a good wind at his back, Pericles arrives in Tarsus. Just imagine his ship and all its cargo, arriving here to take Marina home, who's gone. Watch them move like ghosts and shadows for a while, and then I'll explain in words what you've just seen.","   See how belief may suffer by foul show!    This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;    And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,    With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,    Leaves Tarsus and again embarks.    He swears    Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:    He puts on sackcloth, and to sea.   He bears    A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,    And yet he rides it out.   Now please you wit.    The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza.     [Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument]      'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,    Who wither'd in her spring of year.    She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,    On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;    Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,    Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:    Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,    Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:    Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,    Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'    No visor does become black villany    So well as soft and tender flattery.    Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,    And bear his courses to be ordered    By Lady Fortune;   while our scene must play    His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-dayIn her unholy service.    Patience, then,    And think you now are all in Mytilene.   "
