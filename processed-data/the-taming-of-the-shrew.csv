the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-0,"Tranio, because I have always longed to see Padua and its famous university, I wanted to stop here on my way to fertile Lombardy, that pleasant garden of great Italy. And now, thanks to my father's love and approval, and your own good companyhere I am. So, my trusty, dependable servant, let's rest here a while and begin a course of intellectual studies. I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, along with my father before me: Vincentio of the Bentivoli family. He was a successful merchant and world traveler, and it now seems fitting that I, Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence, should fulfill all my father's hopes for me and increase his wealth with my own virtuous deeds. And therefore, Tranio, I will study virtue for now, and that area of philosophy that discusses how to achieve happiness through virtue. But tell me what you think of all this, for I have left Pisa and come to Padua, and now I feel like I've left a puddle behind and jumped into an ocean, hoping to quench my thirst.","      Mi perdonato,    gentle master mine.    I am in all affected as yourself,    Glad that you thus continue your resolve    To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.    Only, good master, while we do admire    This virtue and this moral discipline,    Lets be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,    Or so devote to Aristotles checks    As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.    Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,    And practice rhetoric in your common talk;    Music and poesy use to quicken you;    The mathematics and the metaphysics    Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.    No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en.    In brief, sir, study what you most affect.   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,"Pardon me, my gentle master. I agree with everything you've said, and I'm glad that you've followed through with your decision to enjoy all the pleasures of sweet philosophy. Only, good master, while we're studying all this admirable virtue and moral discipline, let's not become stoics or stocks, and let's not focus on Aristotle's restraints so much that we forget to read Ovid. Practice your logic with the friends you have, and use rhetoric in everyday talk. Stimulate yourself with music and poetry. And as for mathematics and metaphysicsfollow your appetite, and only study what you can stomach. You'll gain no profit from something you take no pleasure in. In short, sir, study what you enjoy.","   Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.    If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,    We could at once put us in readiness    And take a lodging fit to entertain    Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.    But stay awhile. What company is this?   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-2,"Many thanks, Tranio, for the good advice. If Biondello would come ashore, we could get ready at once and find a place to stay. Then we would have a place to entertain the friends we'll make here in Padua. But wait a minute. Who are all these people?","  Master, some show to welcome us to town.  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,"Master, maybe it's a gathering to welcome us to town.","   Gentlemen, importune me no farther,    For how I firmly am resolved you know    That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter    Before I have a husband for the elder.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-4,"Gentlemen, stop pestering me about this. You know that my mind is made up. I won't let my younger daughter marry until I've found a husband for the elder one. I know and like both of you, so if either of you loves Katherine, then you have my permission to court her as you please.","  To cart her, rather. Shes too rough for me.There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,"To cart her, is more likely.","   [To BAPTISTA]  I pray you, sir, is it your willTo make a stale of me amongst these mates?  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,"[To BAPTISTA] Please, sir, is it your intention to make a laughingstock of me in front of these mates?","  Mates, maid? how mean you that? No mates for you Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,"""Mates,"" girl? What do you mean by that? You won't have any mates until you improve your temper.","   I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.    I wis it is not halfway to her heart.    But if it were, doubt not her care should be    To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool    And paint your face and use you like a fool.   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-8,"Don't worry, sir, you don't need to worry about being my husband. Indeed, marriage doesn't appeal to my heart. But even if it did, the only thing I'd want to do with you is knock you on the head with a three-legged stool, scratch up your face, and make you my fool.","  From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-18,"Sir Baptista, will you really act so unnaturally? I'm sorry that our good will towards Bianca should cause her grief.","  Why will you mew her up,Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hellAnd make her bear the penance of her tongue?  "

So farewell.Katherine, you may stay. I have more to talk about with Bianca.","  Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?

Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out.   Our cakes dough on both sides. Farewell.   Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.   "

"
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-24,"So will I, Sir Gremio. But wait, let me have a word with you first, please. Though we've always been opponents, never allies, when you think about it, it's now important to us both that we regain access to our fair mistress, so that we can once again be friendly rivals competing for Bianca's love. But first we have to work to achieve one thing.","  Whats that, I pray?  "

But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross every morning.  
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-31,I'm not sure. I would rather take her dowry and be whipped in public every morning than have to put up with her.,"   Faith, as you say, theres small choice in rotten apples.   But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptistas eldest daughter to a husband    we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have tot afresh.   Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He thatruns fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-32,"Well, as you say, it's a choice between two evils. But come, since this great obstacle makes us allies, let's be friends until we can find a husband for Baptista's elder daughter. Then we'll set the younger daughter free to be courted, and we can resume our competition. Sweet Bianca! Happy is the man who wins you! To the victor go the spoils. What do you say, Sir Gremio?","  I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-33,"I agree with this plan. If we can find the right man, I'd give him the best horse in Padua to start wooing Katherine immediately, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her! Come on.","  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possibleThat love should of a sudden take such hold?  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-34,"Please tell me, sir, is it possible that love could overpower a person so suddenly?","   O Tranio, till I found it to be true,    I never thought it possible or likely.    But see, while idly I stood looking on,    I found the effect of love in idleness    And now in plainness do confess to thee    That art to me as secret and as dear    As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,    Tranio,   I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,    If I achieve not this young modest girl.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-35,"Oh Tranio, I never thought it possible or likely until it happened to me. But see, while I stood here watching this unfold, I suddenly found myself struck with love. You are as trustworthy and dear to me as Anna was to Dido, Queen of Carthage, so I must plainly confess to you, Tranio: I'm on fire, I'm burning, I'm filled with longing.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-36,"Master, now's not the time to scold you. Affection can't be driven out of the heart.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-41,"Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move, and her breath perfume the air. Everything I saw in her was holy and sweet.","   [aside]   Nay, then, tis time to stir him from his trance.    I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,    Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her.   Thus it stands:    Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd    That till the father rid his hands of her,    Master, your love must live a maid at home,    And therefore has he closely mewed her up,    Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-50,"It's impossible.

We have not yet been seen in any house,    Nor can we be distinguished by our faces    For man or master.   Then it follows thus:    Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,    Keep house and port and servants as I should.    I will some other be, some Florentine,    Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.    'Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once    Uncase thee. Take my colored hat and cloak.   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-51,"Enoughdon't worry, I have it all planned out. No one has seen us yet, so no one knows which of us is the master and which is the servant. So this is how it'll go: you'll be the master, Tranio, and replace me. You'll maintain my rank, live in my house, and keep servants, just as I would do. I, on the other hand, will be some other mansome fellow from Florence or Naples, or a low-ranking man from Pisa. Well, that's the plan, so let's do it. Tranio, undress yourself at once, and put on my colored hat and cloak.","  When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.  "

Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,    While I make way from hence to save my life.    You understand me?   "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-57,"Boy, come here. This is no time for jokes, so get serious. Your fellow Tranio here has taken on my outward appearance to save my life, and I have put on his appearance in order to escape. I've been in a fight since we came ashore, and I killed a man. I'm afraid that someone saw me. So for now you must wait on Tranio like he's your master, while I make my escape and save my life. Do you understand me?","  Aye, sir.  [aside]  Ne'er a whit.  "
the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-1-scene-1.json-line-58,"Yes, sir. ",  And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth. Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,    Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,    And for thy maintenance commits his body    To painful labor both by sea and land,    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,    And craves no other tribute at thy hands    But love, fair looks and true obedience    Too little payment for so great a debt.

And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,    And not obedient to his honest will,    What is she but a foul contending rebel    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?    I am ashamed that women are so simple    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;    Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,    But that our soft conditions and our hearts    Should well agree with our external parts?    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,    My heart as great, my reason haply more,    To bandy word for word and frown for frown.    But now I see our lances are but straws,    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.

the-taming-of-the-shrew-act-5-scene-2.json-line-88,"For shame, for shame! Don't furrow your brow and glare so scornfully to try to wound the man who is your lord, your king, and your governor. It tarnishes your beauty like frost blights the meadows, and ruins your reputation like a strong wind shaking a flower bud. In no sense whatsoever is it appropriate or pleasant. An angry woman is like a stirred-up fountainmuddy, ugly, thick, lacking beautyand while it's in this condition, no one, not even a dry or thirsty man, will stoop to sip or touch one drop of it. Your husband is your lord, your life, your keeper, your head, your ruler, and one who cares for you. To keep you safe and comfortable he commits his body to painful labor on both sea and land, to staying awake on stormy nights and cold days at sea, while you stay at home, warm and secure. And in exchange all he asks for is love, beauty, and true obediencetoo little payment for so great a debt. A woman owes her husband the same obedience that a subject owes to his prince. And when she is stubborn, peevish, sullen, sour, and not obedient to his honest will, then what is she but a foul, vicious rebel, and a cursed traitor to her loving lord? I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should kneel and plead for peace. I'm ashamed that they should seek rulership, supremacy, and power when they are obligated to serve, love and obey. Why else are our bodies so soft and weak and smooth, unfit for labor and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts? Come, come, you weak, willful worms! My mind was once just as arrogant as yours, my courage just as great, and my wit perhaps even better when it came to tossing words back and forth and exchanging frowns for frowns. But now I see that our swords are only straws, our strength is just as weak, and our weakness is beyond compare, so that we seem to be exactly the thing we are not. So humble your pride, for it's useless. Place your hands beneath your husband's boot as a gesture of obedience.
