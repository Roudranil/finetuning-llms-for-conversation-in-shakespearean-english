romeo-and-juliet-act-5-scene-3.json-line-59,Then tell us immediately what you know about all this.,"   I will be brief, for my short date of breath    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,    And she, there dead, that Romeos faithful wife.    I married them, and their stoln marriage day    Was Tybalts doomsday, whose untimely death    Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,    Betrothed and would have married her perforce    To County Paris. Then comes she to me,    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean    To rid her from this second marriage,    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.    Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,    A sleeping potion, which so took effect    As I intended, for it wrought on her    The form of death.    Meantime I writ to Romeo,    That he should hither come as this dire night,    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,    Being the time the potions force should cease.    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,    Was stayed by accident, and yesternight    Returned my letter back. Then all alone    At the prefixèd hour of her waking    Came I to take her from her kindreds vault,    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,    But when I came, some minute ere the time    Of her awakening, here untimely lay    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.    She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,    And bear this work of heaven with patience.    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.    All this I know, and to the marriage    Her Nurse is privy.

But when I arrived, just a few minutes before Juliet awoke, Paris and Romeo were already here, lying dead. She woke up, and I begged her to come out of the tomb with me and bear this work of God with patience. But then a noise frightened me, and I ran from the tomb.

But as for me, I am not made for such games of love, or to admire myself in a mirror. I was badly made, and I lack the good looks to strut in front of passing girls.

She wished she hadn't heard the moving stories, but also wished that God had made her that kind of a man. She thanked me and told me that if I knew anyone who loved her, all he would have to do to woo her was to tell her my stories. Picking up on her hint, I spoke to her.

He swears    Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:    He puts on sackcloth, and to sea.   He bears    A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,    And yet he rides it out.   Now please you wit.    The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza.     [Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument]      'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,    Who wither'd in her spring of year.    She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,    On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;    Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,    Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:    Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,    Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:    Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,    Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'

It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,    And in no sense is meet or amiable.    A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,    Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,    And for thy maintenance commits his body    To painful labor both by sea and land,    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,    And craves no other tribute at thy hands    But love, fair looks and true obedience    Too little payment for so great a debt.    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,    Even such a woman oweth to her husband.    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,    And not obedient to his honest will,    What is she but a foul contending rebel    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?    I am ashamed that women are so simple    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;    Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,    But that our soft conditions and our hearts    Should well agree with our external parts?    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,    My heart as great, my reason haply more,    To bandy word for word and frown for frown.    But now I see our lances are but straws,    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,    And place your hands below your husbands foot:    In token of which duty, if he please,    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.   "
