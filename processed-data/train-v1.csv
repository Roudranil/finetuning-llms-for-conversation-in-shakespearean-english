romeo-and-juliet-act-5-scene-3.json-line-59,Then tell us immediately what you know about all this.,"   I will be brief, for my short date of breath    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,    And she, there dead, that Romeos faithful wife.    I married them, and their stoln marriage day    Was Tybalts doomsday, whose untimely death    Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,    Betrothed and would have married her perforce    To County Paris. Then comes she to me,    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean    To rid her from this second marriage,    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.    Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,    A sleeping potion, which so took effect    As I intended, for it wrought on her    The form of death.    Meantime I writ to Romeo,    That he should hither come as this dire night,    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,    Being the time the potions force should cease.    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,    Was stayed by accident, and yesternight    Returned my letter back. Then all alone    At the prefixÃ¨d hour of her waking    Came I to take her from her kindreds vault,    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,    But when I came, some minute ere the time    Of her awakening, here untimely lay    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.    She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,    And bear this work of heaven with patience.    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.    All this I know, and to the marriage    Her Nurse is privy.

But when I arrived, just a few minutes before Juliet awoke, Paris and Romeo were already here, lying dead. She woke up, and I begged her to come out of the tomb with me and bear this work of God with patience. But then a noise frightened me, and I ran from the tomb.

I told him everything, even from when I was a boy, and spoke about disastrous turns of events, moving events on land and on sea, and about times I barely escaped imminent death by a hair's breadth. I told him about how I was taken prisoner by my enemy and sold into slavery, about how I was ransomed back and how I traveled around through vast caverns and empty deserts, through rough, rocky quarries and hills so high they touch heaven itself. I told him about the cannibals that eat other humans, called the Anthropophagi, and about strange men whose heads grow beneath their shoulders. Desdemona was always fascinated by these stories, but household chores would call her away. She did her chores quickly so she could come back and listen voraciously to my stories again. When I had some spare time, she asked me to expand on the story of my travels and fill her in on what she had only heard parts of. I agreed, and my tales often brought her to tears. When I finished my stories, she would sigh. She would always say things like, ""That was strange, very strange,"" or ""That was pitiful, so pitiful."" She wished she hadn't heard the moving stories, but also wished that God had made her that kind of a man. She thanked me and told me that if I knew anyone who loved her, all he would have to do to woo her was to tell her my stories. Picking up on her hint, I spoke to her.

Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,    That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee    Made him a man   ; and though thou livest and breathest,    Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent    In some large measure to thy father's death,    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,    Who was the model of thy father's life.    Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:    In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:    That which in mean men we intitle patience    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.

richard-ii-act-2-scene-1.json-line-41,"Now, before God, it is a shame that he, a royal prince, is wronged in this way, as are so many more of noble blood in this declining land.

You should have feared lies when you threw feasts with your wealth, but your suspicion comes when you are most poor. What I show you is true love, duty, and enthusiasm for your outstanding mind, along with care for your wellbeing. Believe me, my lord, that any advantage I could gain now I would exchange for one wish: that you had the power and wealth to make yourself rich. That would be the return for my admiration.","   Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,    Here, take: the gods out of my misery    Have sent thee treasure.   Go, live rich and happy;    But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;    Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,    But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,    Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs    What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,    Debts wither 'em to nothing;   be men like    blasted woods,    And may diseases lick up their false bloods!

Heaven is here,    Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,    Live here in heaven and may look on her,    But Romeo may not.   More validity,    More honorable state, more courtship lives    In carrion flies than Romeo.   They may seize    On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.    But Romeo may not. He is banishÃ¨d.    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.    They are free men, but I am banishÃ¨d.    And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
