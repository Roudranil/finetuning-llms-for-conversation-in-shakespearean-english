othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-0,"Psh! Don't say that. Iago, I am not pleased that you've known about this, especially since I've given you access to my wallet as if it were your own.","  'Sblood, but youll not hear me!  If ever I did dream of such a matter, abhor me.  "
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,"Christ, you're not listening to me! I never even dreamed of such a thing. If I did, you'd have every right to hate me.",  Thou toldst meThou didst hold him in thy hate.  
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-2,You told me that you hated him.,"   Despise me    If I do not. Three great ones of the city    (In personal suit to make me his lieutenant)    Off-capped to him, and by the faith of man    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.    But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)    Evades them with a bombast circumstance    Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,    And in conclusion    Nonsuits my mediators.   For Certes, says he,    I have already chose my officer.    And what was he?    Forsooth, a great arithmetician,    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine    A fellow almost damned in a fair wife    That never set a squadron in the field,    Nor the division of a battle knows    More than a spinsterunless the bookish theoric,    Wherein the toged consuls can propose    As masterly as he.   Mere prattle without practice    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th' election    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof    At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds    Christian and heathen,   must be beleed and calmed    By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster    He (in good time) must his lieutenant be    And I, bless the mark, his Moorships ancient.   "
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,"If I don't hate him, you can hate me. Three noblemen of the city tipped their hats to him, making a personal plea for him to make me his lieutenant. And, truly, I know my value, and I'm worthy of that position. But of course Othello is too proud to listen and wants to do things his own way, so he speaks in circles with empty talk about war-related titles. And in the end he declines their proposal and says, ""Certainly, I have already chosen my lieutenant."" And who did he choose? A guy who's basically a mathematician, some Michael Cassio, from Florence. A man practically cursed with a wife too beautiful (whom he can't control). A man who has never commanded a squadron on the battlefield, who knows no more about battle than an old lady. He knows only theory from books, full of the talk of old geezers in togas. His military experience is all ideas, with no real action! But, sir, Othello chose this Cassio for lieutenant, not meeven though he's seen proof of my military prowess with his own eyes at Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on all sorts of battlefields in Christian and Pagan lands. Now, my career's stalled and I'm overtaken by some number cruncheran accountant! That bean-counter will be his lieutenant before too long, and meanwhile I'll be carrying around his Moorship's flag, thank you very much.","  By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.  "
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-4,"God, I'd rather be his executioner than his flag-bearer.","   Why, theres no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service.    Preferment goes by letter and affection,    And not by old gradation, where each second    Stood heir to th' first.   Now sir, be judge yourself,    Whether I in any just term am affined    To love the Moor.   "
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,"Well, there's nothing I can do. That's the price of military service. Promotions are a matter of favoritismbased on whoever the leader likesnot based on rank, with a second officer stepping up to become a first officer, and so on. So now , sir, you be the judge and tell me: do I have any reason at all to love that Moor?",  I would not follow him then.  
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,If I were your position I wouldn't follow him. So why do you?,"   O sir, content you.    I follow him to serve my turn upon him.    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters    Cannot be truly followed.   You shall mark    Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave    That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)    Wears out his time much like his masters ass    For naught but provender, and when hes old, cashiered.    Whip me such honest knaves.   Others there are    Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves    And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,    Do well thrive by them.   And when they have lined their coats,    Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,    And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.    In following him, I follow but myself.    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,    But seeming so, for my peculiar end.    For when my outward action doth demonstrate    The native act and figure of my heart    In compliment extern, tis not long after    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve    For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.   "
othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,"Oh, sir, calm yourself. I'm following him only so I can turn on him later. Maybe we can't all be leaders, but not all leaders can have loyal followers. All the time you see dutiful servants kneeling to their masters and working like mules for nothing but food. And when they get old, they're fired. These honest fools deserve to be whipped! There are others who take the appearance of duty and loyalty, but stay focused on their own interests. They put on a good show of serving their lords, and thrive in their subservient positions. But once they get enough money, they serve only themselves. These are the guys who really have some soul. That's the kind of servant I am. Believe me, as sure as your name is Roderigo: if I were the Moor, I would not want Iago as my servant. In following him, I'm really just following myself. God may judge me. I swear I'm not serving Othello out of love and duty, but merely appearing to, for my own purposes. If my outward appearance showed what my real intentions are, It would be like wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at. I am not what I seem to be.",  What a full fortune does the Thick-lips oweIf he can carryt thus!

But, I beseech you,    Ift be your pleasure and most wise consent    (As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter    At this odd-even and dull watch o' th' night    Transported with no worse nor better guard    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,    If this be known to you and your allowance,    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.    But if you know not this my manners tell me    We have your wrong rebuke.   Do not believe    That, from the sense of all civility,    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.

But if you're not aware of all this, then my own good manners suggest that you're wrong to scold us. Don't think that I would just play around with such a serious matter, contrary to any good manners. I repeat: if you haven't given your daughter permission, then she has seriously rebelled against your authority. She's giving all her obedience, beauty, wit, and wealth to some extravagant, wandering foreigner, who seems to have roots just about everywhere. Go now and see for yourself. If she's in her room, or even in your house, sue me and let the government punish me for lying to you like this.","   Strike on the tinder, ho!    Give me a taper, call up all my people!

In which regard,    Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,    Yet for necessity of present life    I must show out a flag and sign of love,    (Which is indeed but sign).

othello-act-1-scene-1.json-line-37,"[To RODERIGO] Goodbye. I must leave you now. It seems to me neither wise nor appropriate given my position in Othello's service to be brought forward against the Moorand it seems like I will be, if I stay here. Besides, I know that the government cannot get rid of him (even if this whole thing may annoy Brabantio), since he's needed so greatly to fight in the wars with Cyprus that are going on right now. And the government has no one else of his capability to lead their forces, not even if they should trade their own souls for someone. Although I do hate Othello as much as I hate the tortures of Hell, for the time being I must show signs of lovewhich, I assure you, are nothing more than empty signs.

My skill is in war: from the time I was seven-years-old to just nine months ago, I have used the strength of my arms on the battlefield. I cannot speak about much in this great big world besides wartime deeds and battle. Therefore, I probably won't help my case much by speaking for myself.

I did consent,    And often did beguile her of her tears    When I did speak of some distressful stroke    That my youth suffered.

She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished    That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked me    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,    I should but teach him how to tell my story    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.    She loved me for the dangers I had passed,    And I loved her that she did pity them.    This only is the witchcraft I have used.    Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.   "
othello-act-1-scene-3.json-line-40,"Her father loved me and often invited me to his house, where he would ask about the story of my life, about the battles and sieges I've fought in, and the good and bad fortune I've had. I told him everything, even from when I was a boy, and spoke about disastrous turns of events, moving events on land and on sea, and about times I barely escaped imminent death by a hair's breadth. I told him about how I was taken prisoner by my enemy and sold into slavery, about how I was ransomed back and how I traveled around through vast caverns and empty deserts, through rough, rocky quarries and hills so high they touch heaven itself. I told him about the cannibals that eat other humans, called the Anthropophagi, and about strange men whose heads grow beneath their shoulders. Desdemona was always fascinated by these stories, but household chores would call her away. She did her chores quickly so she could come back and listen voraciously to my stories again. When I had some spare time, she asked me to expand on the story of my travels and fill her in on what she had only heard parts of. I agreed, and my tales often brought her to tears. When I finished my stories, she would sigh. She would always say things like, ""That was strange, very strange,"" or ""That was pitiful, so pitiful."" She wished she hadn't heard the moving stories, but also wished that God had made her that kind of a man. She thanked me and told me that if I knew anyone who loved her, all he would have to do to woo her was to tell her my stories. Picking up on her hint, I spoke to her. She loved me for the dangers I had endured, and I loved her because she pitied me for having endured them. This is the only witchcraft I have used. Here comes the woman herself.

When there's nothing you can do to fix a situation, there's no use crying about it anymore, because you've already survived seeing the worst outcome of your former hopes. To be sad after something bad happens only makes it worse. When fortune takes something away from you, you make a mockery of your trouble by being patient. If you've been robbed, it's better to smile and take away the thief's pleasure of making you upset than to grieve about it, and rob yourself even further of good cheer.","   So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,    We lose it not, so long as we can smile.    He bears the sentence well that nothing bears    But the free comfort which from thence he hears.    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.    These sentences to sugar or to gall,    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.    But words are words. I never yet did hear    That the bruised heart was piercèd through the ears.    I humbly beseech you, proceed to th' affairs of state.   "
othello-act-1-scene-3.json-line-46,"If that's true, then let the Turks take Cyprus from us, and we'll be fine as long as we smile. It's easy to use a proverb when you're not the one suffering a loss, and not so easy when you're the one suffering grief. These sayings mean nothing. I've never heard of a time someone's broken heart was made better by words. I humbly beg you to move on to the state business.","   The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.

Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, butfor bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating?   Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she haveto look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties.   All which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will finditself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice.

Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions that has an eye, can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself. A devilish knave.

othello-act-2-scene-1.json-line-81,"Quiet for a second, and listen up. Remember how quickly she fell in love with the Moor, all over some bragging and made-up fantastical stories.

When she gets bored with having sex, she'll need to find something to inflame her passion againsomeone good-looking, closer to her age, and more like her in behavior and appearance. She'll find none of this in the Moor. Without any of these desirable things, she'll get so sick of the Moor she'll want to throw up. Her very nature will compel her to find a second man. Now, sir, given all this obvious information, who do you think she will turn to if not Cassio? He's eloquent, and puts up a facade of good manners to hide his real desires. She'll choose no one but him. He's a tricky, opportunistic villain, who takes advantage of situations. He's a devilish fool.

Now, I do love her too,    Not out of absolute lustthough peradventure    I stand accountant for as great a sin    But partly led to diet my revenge,    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor    Hath leaped into my seat.

othello-act-2-scene-3.json-line-70,"Noble Othello, I am seriously injured. So that I save my energy by not speaking, your officer Iago can tell you all that I know.

othello-act-2-scene-3.json-line-72,"If you don't tell the truth because you're partial to Cassio, then you don't deserve the title of soldier.","   Touch me not so near.    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth    Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.    Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth    Shall nothing wrong him. This it is, general:    Montano and myself being in speech,    There comes a fellow crying out for help    And Cassio following him with determined sword    To execute upon him.   Sir, this gentleman    Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause,    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,    Lest by his clamoras it so fell out    The town might fall in fright.   He, swift of foot,    Outran my purpose, and I returned then rather    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords    And Cassio high in oath,   which till tonight    I ne'er might say before.

But men are men, the best sometimes forget.    Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,    Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received    From him that fled some strange indignity    Which patience could not pass.   "
othello-act-2-scene-3.json-line-73,"Don't accuse me of such a thing. I would rather have my tongue cut out of my mouth than speak ill of Michael Cassio. But I think that speaking the truth cannot wrong him. This is the truth, general: Montano and I were talking, and all of a sudden a man came crying out for help, and Cassio was chasing after him with his sword drawn. Sir, this gentleman stepped in to stop Cassio, while I chased after the shouting man, because I was worried his clamor would awaken and scare the townspeople. He was too fast for me, though, so I returned here, as I heard the clink of swords and Cassio swearing oaths. I've never heard Cassio talk like that before. When I got back here I found these two fighting, just as they were when you got here and separated them. That's all I know. In his rage, Cassio wronged Montano, who was only trying to help, but I think that Cassio must have received some strange insult from the man who ran away that he simply couldn't tolerate.","  I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,Making it light to Cassio.

Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving.   You have lost no reputation at all unless yourepute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are waysto recover the general again.   You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and hes yours.   "
othello-act-2-scene-3.json-line-83,"I'm an honest man who takes things literally, so I thought you had been seriously wounded. That would be worse than losing your reputation. Reputation is an empty, stupid idea. Often people get good reputations when they don't deserve it, and people lose their reputations unfairly. You haven't lost your reputation unless you consider yourself to have lost it. Come on, man, there are ways to gain back the general's favor. He's just in a bad mood, and he punished you because he had to in front of the men of Cyprus, not because he dislikes you. It's like someone beating their dog in front of a strong lion, when the dog did nothing wrong, just to show the lion that he's powerful. Ask Othello's pardon, and he'll be your friend again.","   I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.   Drunk?

When this advice is free I give and honest,    Probal to thinking and indeed the course    To win the Moor again?   For tis most easy    Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue    In any honest suit. Shes framed as fruitful    As the free elements.   And then for her    To win the Moor, were to renounce his baptism,    All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin,    His soul is so enfettered to her love,    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,    Even as her appetite shall play the god    With his weak function. How am I then a villain    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!    When devils will the blackest sins put on    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows    As I do now.   For whiles this honest fool    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,    Ill pour this pestilence into his ear:    That she repeals him for her bodys lust.    And by how much she strives to do him good    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.

othello-act-2-scene-3.json-line-101,"Who could say that I'm a villain, when I give free and honest advice that is helpful for Cassio in winning back the Moor's favor? For it really is easy to persuade Desdemona to help you in anything. She gives rise to as many good things as nature itself. And Othello is such a slave to his love for her that he would renounce his baptism and reject all symbols of Christian redemption to win her over. She can do whatever she wants, and whatever she desires he will carry out. How then could I be a villain, when I am advising Cassio to do what is in his best interest? That's Satan's theology! When devils do the worst sins, they first put on the pretense of goodness and innocence, as I am doing now. For while this honest fool begs Desdemona to fix his misfortune and while she pleads on his behalf to the Moor, I'll poison Othello's thoughts by whispering into his ear. I'll say that Desdemona is standing up for Cassio because she is attracted to him. The more that she argues for Cassio, the guiltier she'll seem to the Moor. In this way I'll turn her own virtue into a sort of tar, to entrap herand everyone elsewith her own goodness.","  How now, Roderigo!  "

But he protests he loves you    And needs no other suitor but his likings    To take the safest occasion by the front    To bring you in again.   "
othello-act-3-scene-1.json-line-22,"Good morning, good Lieutenant. I am sorry for what has happened to you, but I'm sure everything will turn out okay. The general and his wife are talking about the situation, and Desdemona is speaking up for you. Othello says that the man you hurt is well-known and well-liked in Cyprus, and that he has no choice but to refuse your appeal.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-5,"Yes, but, my lady, I worry that he may keep this distance for so longbecause it is easier to keep doing it, or because some accident or other makes it necessarythat he will forget my love and service to him while I am gone and someone else is in my place.","   Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here    I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,    If I do vow a friendship, Ill perform it    To the last article.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-6,"Don't worry about that. With Emilia here as my witness, I guarantee that you will have your place back as lieutenant. I assure you, when I promise to do something out of friendship, I deliver. My husband won't have a moment of rest because I'll keep him awake all night to talk his ear off about this.

When shall he come?    Tell me, Othello.   I wonder in my soul    What you would ask me that I should deny    Or stand so mamm'ring on. What?   Michael Cassio    That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,    Hath ta'en your part,   to have so much to do    To bring him in?

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-29,"Then do it tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday at noon, or Tuesday night, or even Wednesday morning. You name the time, but please sometime within the next three days. Truly, he regrets what he's done, and his error wasn't really that seriousexcept that, as they say, military discipline requires that you be most strict with the best soldiersand should barely have even required a private scolding . When will Cassio come back? Tell me, Othello. If you asked me for something, I wouldn't just say no, or stand there hesitating. What do you say? Michael Cassio helped you when you were courting me, and whenever I criticized you he stood up for you. Why should it be so hard for him to get to talk with you? Trust me, I could do a lot","  Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will,I will deny thee nothing.  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-30,"Please, don't talk anymore about this. Let Cassio come when he wants. I won't deny you what you want.","   Why, this is not a boon,    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit    To your own person.   Nay, when I have a suit    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight    And fearful to be granted.   "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-31,"This isn't a great favor you're doing me. It's as if I'm trying to persuade you to put on gloves when it's cold out, or to eat healthy food, or to keep yourself warm, or to do anything that's good for you. No, when I have something to ask of you that will really test your love, it will be a difficult, serious thing, one that you wouldn't grant easily.","  I will deny thee nothing! Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this,To leave me but a little to myself.  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-32,I will never say no to you! All I ask of you right now is that you leave me alone for a bit.,"  Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.  "

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-39,Did Michael Cassio know about your love for Desdemona when you were courting her?,"  He did, from first to last.Why dost thou ask?  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-40,"He did, from the very beginning. Why do you ask?","  But for a satisfaction of my thought,No further harm.  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-41,"Oh, no reason. I was just curious.","  Why of thy thought, Iago?  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-42,"Why were you curious, Iago?",  I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-44,"Oh, yes he knew her, and often carried messages between Desdemona and me.",  Indeed?  
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-45,Really?,"  Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discernst thou aught in that? Is he not honest?  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-46,"What do you mean, ""really?"" Yes, really. You think something's strange about that? Isn't Cassio honest?","  Honest, my lord?  "

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-51,"Think, my lord?","   Think, my lord? Alas, thou echost me    As if there were some monster in thy thought    Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.    I heard thee say even now thou likst not that    When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?    And when I told thee he was of my counsel    Of my whole course of wooing, thou criedst Indeed?    And didst contract and purse thy brow together    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain    Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me    Show me thy thought.   "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-52,"""Think, my lord?"" Come on, you're repeating everything I say like a strange monster in your mind that you're afraid is to hideous to show. You're hinting at something. You just said earlier that you didn't like how Cassio left my wife's side. What about it didn't you like? And when I told you that Cassio advised me the whole time I was courting Desdemona, you said, ""Oh really?"" And you raised your eyebrows like you had some secret thought about it. If you care about me at all, tell me what you're thinking.","  My lord, you know I love you.  "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-53,"My lord, you know I care about you.","   I think thou dost.    And for I know thou 'rt full of love and honesty    And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath,    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.    For such things in a false disloyal knave    Are tricks of custom, but in a man thats just    They are close dilations, working from the heart,    That passion cannot rule.   "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-54,"I think you do. And it's precisely because I know you are full of love and honesty and think carefully before you speak that I'm even more worried about the way you're hesitating. In some disloyal liar, it wouldn't mean anything, but in an honest man like you, these kinds of reactions are indications of thoughts that come from the heart which cannot be clouded by emotion.","  For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-55,"As far as Michael Cassio goes, I think I can swear that he is honest.",  I think so too.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-69,"Oh, my lord, beware of jealousy! It is a green-eyed monster that mocks whoever it eats away at.

othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-71,"To be poor but content is actually to be quite rich. But you can have endless riches and still be as poor as anyone if you are always afraid of losing your riches. Good heaven, defend us all from jealousy!","   Why, why is this?    Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy,    To follow still the changes of the moon    With fresh suspicions? No!

'Tis not to make me jealous    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,    Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances.    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.    Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,    For she had eyes and chose me.   No, Iago,    Ill see before I doubt, when I doubt, prove,    And on the proof there is no more but this:    Away at once with love or jealousy!   "
othello-act-3-scene-3.json-line-72,"Why would say that? Do you think I would make jealousy my whole life, and with every change in the moon find new suspicions? No! To doubt once is to make up your mind. I'd rather turn into a goat than devote all my time to such overblown suspicions, like the sort of jealous man you're describing. It wouldn't make me jealous for you to say that my wife is pretty, eats well, enjoys the company of others, speaks her mind, sings, plays music, and dances. When a woman is virtuous, these traits are virtuous as well. And I will not worry or fear that she may be unfaithful because I am not very desirable. She knew who she was marrying. No, Iago, I won't doubt Desdemona until I see something, and if I doubt her I'll see if I can prove it.

Or let's say they hit us, or spitefully cut back on our allowance. Why, we feel resentment, and although we have some grace, we can still have some revenge, too.
