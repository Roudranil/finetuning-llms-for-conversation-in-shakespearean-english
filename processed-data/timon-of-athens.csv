timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-0,Hello.,  I am glad you're well.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,It's good to see you.,  I have not seen you long: how goes the world?  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-2,It's been a while. How is everything in your world?,"  It wears, sir, as it grows.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,"Up and down, up and down.","   Ay, that's well known:    But what particular rarity?   what strange,    Which manifold record not matches? See,    Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power    Hath conjured to attend.   I know the merchant.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-4,"So they say. But how weird is thishave you ever seen anything like it? Look at how amazing wealth and generosity are, how they can summon all these people to attend to them. I know this merchant.",  I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,I know both of them. The other one is a jeweler.,"  O, 'tis a worthy lord.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,"Such a worthy man, this lord.","  Nay, that's most fix'd.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,Definitely.,"  A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,To an untirable and continuate goodness:He passes.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-8,"There's no one like him, almost born to be forever generous. He exceeds everyone else.",  I have a jewel here  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-9,I have a jewel right here,"  O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-10,"Oh please, let's see it. Is it for the Lord Timon?","  If he will touch the estimate: but, for that  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-11,If he will pay the price. But for that,"   [Reciting to himself]   'When we for recompense have    praised the vile,    It stains the glory in that happy verse    Which aptly sings the good.'   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-12,"[Reciting a poem to himself] ""When we write poetry praising bad things for money, it ruins the better verse that rightly supports good things.""",  'Tis a good form.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-13,[Looking at the jewel] It's beautiful.,"  And rich: here is a water, look ye.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-14,And expensive from the looks of it. Look at how it shines!,"  You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedicationTo the great lord.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-15,"You are captivated by some task, writing a poetic dedication to Lord Timon.","   A thing slipp'd idly from me.    Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes    From whence 'tis nourish'd:   the fire i' the flint    Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame    Provokes itself and like the current flies    Each bound it chafes. What have you there?   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-16,"Something slipped my mind. Poetry is like sap that oozes from the tree it gets its nutrients from. The spark that illuminates in the flint does not reveal itself until the flint is hit with something, but our gentle flame lights itself up and runs like a current over every surface it touches. What is that right there?","  A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-17,A portrait. When will your book be published?,"  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.Let's see your piece.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-18,After I have presented my poem to Timon. Let me see your painting.,  'Tis a good piece.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-19,It's nice.,  So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-20,"Yes, it looks well made.",  Indifferent.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-21,It's not bad.,   Admirable: how this grace    Speaks his own standing!   what a mental power    This eye shoots forth! how big imagination    Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture    One might interpret.   
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-22,It is incredible how its beauty reflects the dignity of its subject! Look at the intelligence that twinkles in the eye! There is a certain imagination that moves in its lip! Even though the painting is silent I feel like I could understand what the man is saying.,  It is a pretty mocking of the life.Here is a touch; is't good?  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-23,"It is a pretty good imitation of life. Here is a nice touch, do you like it?","  I will say of it,It tutors nature: artificial strifeLives in these touches, livelier than life.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-24,I will admit it does represent nature well. The purpose of artlies in these touches. They're almost livelier than life itself.,  How this lord is follow'd!  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-25,Look at all the people following the lord!,  The senators of Athens: happy man!  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-26,They're Senators of Athens. How lucky is he!,"  Look, more!  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-27,And more too!,"   You see this confluence, this great flood    of visitors.    I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,    Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug    With amplest entertainment:   my free drift    Halts not particularly, but moves itself    In a wide sea of wax:   no levell'd malice    Infects one comma in the course I hold;    But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,    Leaving no tract behind.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-28,"Look at this huge crowd of flooding visitors. I have in this draft of my poem drawn the outline of a man beloved and embraced by the earthly world. I do not mean to represent particular people, but work in generalities as if my tablet were an entire sea of wax. Personal grudges do not affect even the smallest details of my writing. My creative process flies forth, strong as an eagle in flight, and leaves no trace of its earthly inspirations.",  How shall I understand you?  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-29,How could I possibly understand what you're talking about?,"   I will unbolt to you.    You see how all conditions, how all minds,    As well of glib and slippery creatures as    Of grave and austere quality, tender down    Their services to Lord Timon:   his large fortune    Upon his good and gracious nature hanging    Subdues and properties to his love and tendance    All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer    To Apemantus, that few things loves better    Than to abhor himself:   even he drops down    The knee before him, and returns in peace    Most rich in Timon's nod.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-30,"I will unlock the meaning for you. Notice how people of all types and temperaments, whether smooth-talking and self-interested or serious and truthful, offer their services to Lord Timon. His immense wealth and his kind and gracious nature overwhelm people, and buy him the approval of all sorts of people eager to love and attend him, from the flatterer whose face mirrors the wishes of his counterpart, to Apemantus, who loves nothing more than hating himself. Even he bows down on his knees to Timon, and leaves peacefully after receiving Timon's approval.",  I saw them speak together.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-31,I did see them speaking to one another.,"   Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill    Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount    Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,    That labour on the bosom of this sphere    To propagate their states:   amongst them all,    Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,    One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,    Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;    Whose present grace to present slaves and servants    Translates his rivals.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-32,"[Speaking of the content of his poem] I have written down here that the goddess Fortune is sitting high atop her throne on a beautiful hill. The base of the mountain is surrounded by men of all stations, all dispositions, all trying their hardest to get richer while on earth. Among all of these men, who watch Fortune attentively, I have one meant to represent Lord Timon, whom Fortune beckons to her, instantly transforming all of the other men, his rivals, into servants and slaves.","   'Tis conceived to scope.    This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,    With one man beckon'd from the rest below,    Bowing his head against the sleepy mount    To climb his happiness, would be well express'd    In our condition.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-33,"How well you've depicted the scene! This throne, this depiction of Fortune, and this hillwith one man beckoned from the rest below, bowing his head before the great mountain on which Fortune sits, the source of his happinessperfectly captures the human condition.","   Nay, sir, but hear me on.    All those which were his fellows but of late,    Some better than his value, on the moment    Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,    Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,    Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him    Drink the free air.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-34,"Sir, listen to some more of the poem. All of those men who were his equals, some of an even better rank, immediately follow him, so that his rooms are suddenly filled with attendants who shower his ears with whispers of their sacrificial devotion to him, and make sacred even his mounting of a horse, as if it were only because of him that they could breathe.","  Ay, marry, what of these?  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-35,"Indeed, and what do we make of these people?","   When Fortune in her shift and change of mood    Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants    Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top    Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,    Not one accompanying his declining foot.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-36,"The moment Fortune changes her mind and spurns this newly chosen man, all of those who depended on him and who helped him on their hands and knees to reach the mountain top, they let him slip without even trying to save him.",   'Tis common:    A thousand moral paintings I can show    That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's    More pregnantly than words.   Yet you do well    To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen    The foot above the head.   
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-37,That is true. I can show you a thousand paintings of moral lessons that demonstrate Fortune's sudden victims more effectively than words ever could. But you'd do well nevertheless to show the Lord Timon that even we commoners can see that he is falling.,"  Imprison'd is he, say you?  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-38,You say that he is imprisoned?,"   Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,    His means most short, his creditors most strait:    Your honourable letter he desires    To those have shut him up; which failing,    Periods his comfort.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-39,"Yes, my good lord: he owes five talents, and even though he has such a small income, his creditors are insistent that he give it back right away. He wants a letter from you to those who have imprisoned him, without which he claims he'll have no comfort.","   Noble Ventidius! Well;    I am not of that feather to shake off    My friend when he must need me.   I do know him    A gentleman that well deserves a help:    Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,    and free him.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-40,"Great Ventidius! Well, I am not the type of man to neglect a friend in need. I know that he is a gentleman that deserves assistance, which he will get. I'll pay the debt for his freedom.",  Your lordship ever binds him.  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-41,Your lordship always makes him grateful.,"   Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;    And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.    'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,    But to support him after. Fare you well.   "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-42,Give him my regards. I will send his ransom and when he is free I will ask him to come to me. It is not enough simply to help the weak stand. One must also support them after helping them up. Farewell.,  All happiness to your honour!  
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-43,Goodbye. Be well!,"  Lord Timon, hear me speak.  "
timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-44,"Lord Timon, would you hear me speak?","  Freely, good father.  "

timon-of-athens-act-1-scene-1.json-line-51,"This man, Lord Timon, this dependent of yours, comes by my house at night. I am a man who has been thrifty from the start, and my estate deserves an heir of better rank than this lowly waiter here.",  Well; what further?

I ask the gods sometimes, why would friends be so necessary if we never had any need for them? They would be the most useless creatures alive if we never had any use for them, and would be like beautiful instruments hung up in cases, but keeping their sounds to themselves.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-1,"We've heard as much, even though we've never met the man.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-2,"Psh, no, don't believe the rumors.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-14,You're serious?,"  Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.  "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-15,"Yes, I swear.","   What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself    against such a good time, when I might ha' shown    myself honourable!   how unluckily it happened, that I    should purchase the day before for a little part,    and undo a great deal of honoured!   Servilius, now,    before the gods, I am not able to do,the more    beast, I say:I was sending to use Lord Timon    myself, these gentlemen can witness!   but I would    not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-21,Yes.,"   Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the    same piece    Is every flatterer's spirit.   Who can call him    His friend that dips in the same dish?   for, in    My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,    And kept his credit with his purse,    Supported his estate;   nay, Timon's money    Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,    But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;    And yetO, see the monstrousness of man    When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!    He does deny him, in respect of his,    What charitable men afford to beggars.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-22,"That's what the world is like, and every flatterer is the same. What is a friend who takes so much? Timon was so good to Lucilius, and kept him afloat with his own money. It's Timon who paid for his servants, and he never enjoys anything that does not owe itself to him. But how monstrous he looks for being so ungrateful! He denies him what rich men would give to beggars.",  Religion groans at it.  
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-2.json-line-23,It's unholy.,"   For mine own part,    I never tasted Timon in my life,    Nor came any of his bounties over me,    To mark me for his friend;   yet, I protest,    For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue    And honourable carriage,    Had his necessity made use of me,    I would have put my wealth into donation,    And the best half should have return'd to him,    So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,    Men must learn now with pity to dispense;    For policy sits above conscience.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-3.json-line-0,"Should Timon really have to struggle for this? He could go to Lord Lucius or Lucullus for a loan, and he could also call on the rich Ventidius, who is free from prison thanks to Timon. All these men owe some of their wealth to Timon.","  My lord,They have all been touch'd and found base metal, forThey have all denied him.  "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-3.json-line-1,"All those men must be under some wicked influence, because they all denied him.","   How! have they denied him?    Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?    And does he send to me? Three? hum!    It shows but little love or judgment in him:    Must I be his last refuge!   His friends, like    physicians,    Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?    Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,    That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,    But his occasion might have woo'd me first;    For, in my conscience, I was the first man    That e'er received gift from him:    And does he think so backwardly of me now,    That I'll requite its last? No:    So it may prove an argument of laughter    To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.    I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum,    Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;    I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,    And with their faint reply this answer join;    Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-3.json-line-2,"No way! Ventidius and Lucullus denied him? Has he approached me for a loan? It shows little Timon's friends loved him that all three of these men refused him, and now I must be his last hope! All his friends benefitted from the charity that leaves him without money, and now leave him for broke like doctor does a case he has deemed helpless. Must I now try to cure him of his debts? What a disgrace and an unenviable position for me! I cannot understand why he did not come to me firstI was the first to receive a gift from him, after all. Does he think so poorly of me as to believe I would be the last to repay him? No, and that way I'll have reason to laugh at him and all the others, who have called me an idiot. If Timon had approached me first, I would have three times the amount he asks for. But now, servant, go back to him and tell him this: whoever scorns me this way will never get my money. ","   Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The    devil knew not what he did when he made man    politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot    think but, in the end, the villainies of man will    set him clear.   How fairly this lord strives to    appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,    like those that under hot ardent zeal would set    whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his    politic love.    This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,    Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,    Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards    Many a bounteous year must be employ'd    Now to guard sure their master.    And this is all a liberal course allows;    Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.   "

I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;    That is one may reach deep enough, and yet    Find little.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-4.json-line-13,"Yeah, but the days have become shorter for him, because you should remember that the path of extravagance descends like the sun in winter, even if it does not regain its height the following year.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-4.json-line-33,We want the money Timon owes.,"   Ay,    If money were as certain as your waiting,    'Twere sure enough.    Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,    When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?    Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts    And take down the interest into their    gluttonous maws.    You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;    Let me pass quietly:    Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;    I have no more to reckon, he to spend.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-4.json-line-34,"Yes, if only money were as sure a thing as you all asking for it, then you would definitely have it. Why didn't your masters send you to pay the bills for the food they ate off Timon's plate? That way, they could smile and enjoy the debts he incurred and then shovel all the interest he owed into their greedy mouths. You're not doing yourself any favors riling me up like this. Let me go.

Now we'll know what is going on.,"   If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some    other hour, I should derive much from't;   for,    take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to    discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;    he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-4.json-line-40,"If I may ask, gentleman, please come back some other time, and it will help me a great deal. I swear, Timon is extremely upset.

timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-2,"What, captain?","   I am an humble suitor to your virtues;    For pity is the virtue of the law,    And none but tyrants use it cruelly.    It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy    Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,    Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth    To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.    He is a man, setting his fate aside,    Of comely virtues:    Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice    An honour in him which buys out his fault    But with a noble fury and fair spirit,    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,    He did oppose his foe:    And with such sober and unnoted passion    He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,    As if he had but proved an argument.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-3,"I stand before you virtuous men to ask a favor. The law is a merciful thing, which only a tyrant could use for cruel purposes. Time and hard luck have worked against a friend of mine who recently broke the law in a fit of rage, a state which unfortunately the law does not consider when men break it. My friend, this action aside, is a good man, who in the moment actually acted without cowardicesomething which ought to be held against his crimeby bravely identifying and responding to one who had ruined his reputation. He opposed this enemy with a clearheaded and calculating passion, expressing his anger with a certain coldness, almost as if he were proving a point.","   You undergo too strict a paradox,    Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:    Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd    To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling    Upon the head of valour;   which indeed    Is valour misbegot and came into the world    When sects and factions were newly born:    He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer    The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs    His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,    carelessly,    And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,    To bring it into danger.    If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,    What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-4,"Your argument is contradictory, a forced attempt to make gross actions seem justifiable. Your rhetoric reaches almost to the point of labor as it tries to turn murder into a mere formality and feuding into an act of valor. Feuds actually prove to be valor in its most degenerate form, as they come from the formation of rivalries. A man is truly valiant only when he can endure the worst insults men can speak, and even wear them like clothing without a care in the world. True valor never takes injury to heart, or retaliates in violence. If acts of injustice are in fact evil and force us to kill others, how dumb it would be then to risk your life for such a cause!","  My lord,  "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-5,But,"  You cannot make gross sins look clear:To revenge is no valour, but to bear.  "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-6,"You cannot make terrible sins look innocent. Valor is patience, not revenge.","   My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,    If I speak like a captain.    Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,    And not endure all threats?   sleep upon't,    And let the foes quietly cut their throats,    Without repugnancy? If there be    Such valour in the bearing, what make we    Abroad? why then, women are more valiant    That stay at home,   if bearing carry it,    And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon    Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,    If wisdom be in suffering.   O my lords,    As you are great, be pitifully good:    Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?    To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;    But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.    To be in anger is impiety;    But who is man that is not angry?    Weigh but the crime with this.   "
timon-of-athens-act-3-scene-5.json-line-7,"Then forgive me for speaking like a military man, my lords. Why do good people fight and not patiently bear the insults of their enemies? Why do they not patiently let those same enemies murder them in their sleep? If there is such honor in patience, what do we make of our wars abroad, and why are women not considered more valiant for staying at home? Why do we not deem the donkey superior to the lion, or the prisoner to the judge, if there is such wisdom in suffering? You are great men, be compassionate. Who would not sentence a man for violent aggression? You are right, murder is the greatest sin, but when it is done for self-defense it is fair. Anger is wicked, but who has not been angry before?

How bravely did he fight and wound many men in the last battle?,"   He has made too much plenty with 'em;    He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often    Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:    If there were no foes, that were enough    To overcome him: in that beastly fury    He has been known to commit outrages,    And cherish factions:   'tis inferr'd to us,    His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-8,"Set your foot against the ramped-up walls and they will open, but you should tell us before you come in peace.","   Throw thy glove,    Or any token of thine honour else,    That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress    And not as our confusion,   all thy powers    Shall make their harbour in our town, till we    Have seal'd thy full desire.   "
timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-9,"Throw your gauntlet down, but do it so that you may use your army to redress the wrongs done to you, and not to destroy everyone here. You can put your entire force here peacefully until you get what you want.","   Then there's my glove;    Descend, and open your uncharged ports:    Those enemies of Timon's and mine own    Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof    Fall and no more:   and, to atone your fears    With my more noble meaning, not a man    Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream    Of regular justice in your city's bounds,    But shall be render'd to your public laws    At heaviest answer.   "
timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-10,"There's my glove, then. Descend now and open your gates. Those who were enemies of Timon and me you will hand over. They, and no one else, will die. And to calm your fear of me, no man of mine shall go beyond an assigned area, or disturb the peace within the city. If they do they will have to answer to harsh punishment.",  'Tis most nobly spoken.  
timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-11,Well said.,"  Descend, and keep your words.  "
timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-12,Descend and do what you have promised.,"   My noble general, Timon is dead;    Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;    And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which    With wax I brought away, whose soft impression    Interprets for my poor ignorance.   "
timon-of-athens-act-5-scene-4.json-line-13,"My noble general, Timon is dead. His grave lies on the shore, and on that tombstone there is this epitaph, which I brought here on wax which will show you what I cannot in ignorance.","   [Reads the epitaph]   'Here lies a    wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:    Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked    caitiffs left!    Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:    Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay    not here thy gait.'    These well express in thee thy latter spirits:    Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,    Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our    droplets which    From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit    Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye    On thy low grave, on faults forgiven.   Dead    Is noble Timon: of whose memory    Hereafter more.   Bring me into your city,    And I will use the olive with my sword,    Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each    Prescribe to other as each other's leech.    Let our drums strike.   "
