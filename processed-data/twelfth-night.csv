twelfth-night-act-2-scene-4.json-line-13,"Then she's too old, by heaven. A woman should be with a man older than she is, so she can adapt herself to her husband and keep his love constant.

twelfth-night-act-2-scene-4.json-line-17,"Oh, you fellow, come sing the song we heard last night. Listen closely to it, Cesario, it's a simple old song.
