"
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-1,I think the King of Sicily is planning to visit the King of Bohemia this coming summer (as he should).,  Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will bejustified in our loves; for indeed

the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-3,"Oh, come on","   Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:    we cannot with such magnificencein so rareI know not what to say.     We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-4,"No, really, I'm being honestwe can't compete with such over-the-top, such amazingI don't even know what to say. We'll have to spike your drinks so that you get really groggy and won't be able to compliment or criticize our party.",  You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-5,You don't have to pay us back for anything; everything we give is a gift.,"  Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs meand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-6,I'm only saying what I know to be true. I'm being completely honest with you.,"   Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.    They were trained together in their childhoods; and    there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,    which cannot choose but branch now.   Since their    more mature dignities and royal necessities made    separation of their society,   their encounters,    though not personal, have been royally attorneyed    with interchange of gifts, letters, loving    embassies;   that they have seemed to be together,    though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and    embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed    winds.   The heavens continue their loves!   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-7,"It would be impossible for the King of Sicily to be too kind to the King of Bohemia. They went to school together when they were kids and became really close, though, naturally, they've grown apart since. Once they reached adulthood and were crowned as kings, they had to attend to business in their respective countries. Though they haven't been able to meet in person, they've exchanged gifts and letters and have sent servants on their behalf. They haven't really been together, of course, but it's as if they were shaking hands or hugging from opposite sides of the globe. God bless their friendship!",   I think there is not in the world either malice or    matter to alter it.   You have an unspeakable    comfort of your young prince Mamillius:   it is a    gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came    into my note.   
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-8,"I don't think anything in the world could change it. You're so lucky to have your young prince, Mamillius. He's the most promising kid I've ever met.","   I very well agree with you in the hopes of him:   it    is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the    subject, makes old hearts fresh:   they that went on    crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to    see him a man.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-9,"I couldn't agree with you more; I have high expectations for him. He's a great kidlike chicken soup for the soul, he keeps us old folks young. The Sicilians who were old and in wheelchairs before he was even born are hoping they live to see him grow up.",  Would they else be content to die?  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-10,"Otherwise, would they be happy to die?",  Yes; if there were no other excuse why they shoulddesire to live.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-1.json-line-11,"Yes, if they had nothing else to live for.","  If the king had no son, they would desire to liveon crutches till he had one.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-0,"It's been nine months since I left my throne in Bohemia without a care in the world. I'd be happy to stay another nine months, brother, except that I would owe you forever. All I can repay you with are my thanks! That being said, I'll have to multiply my single ""thank you"" into many thousands more.",  Stay your thanks a while;And pay them when you part.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-1,"Oh, stop thanking me. You can ""pay"" me when you leave.","   Sir, that's to-morrow.    I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance    Or breed upon our absence;   that may blow    No sneaking winds at home, to make us say    'This is put forth too truly:'   besides, I have stay'd    To tire your royalty.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-2,"I'm leaving tomorrow, sir. I'm worried about what might have happened in Bohemia while I've been goneunfavorable winds may be blowing, if you know what I mean. Besides, I've over-stayed my welcome here and I've worn you out.","  We are tougher, brother,Than you can put us to't.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-3,I'm tougher than you give me credit for!,  No longer stay.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-4,I can't stay any longer.,  One seven-night longer.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-5,Just one more week?,"  Very sooth, to-morrow.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-6,"Really, tomorrow.",  We'll part the time between's then; and in thatI'll no gainsaying.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-7,"We'll say goodbye in a week, and after that I won't argue any more.","   Press me not, beseech you, so.    There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,    So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,    Were there necessity in your request, although    'Twere needful I denied it.   My affairs    Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder    Were in your love a whip to me;   my stay    To you a charge and trouble: to save both,    Farewell, our brother.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-8,"Please, stop pushing me. There is no one in the whole world better at convincing me to do things than you. And now, if you really needed me, you would have almost won me overexcept that I'd still have to say ""no."" Duty calls and I have to go home. If you keep me here, you'll only be hurting me in the long run; if I stay, I'll only be a burden to your hospitality. So if I leave, it's a win-win! Goodbye, brother.","  Tongue-tied, our queen?speak you.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-9,"Hermione, are you tongue-tied? Say something!","   I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until    You have drawn oaths from him not to stay.   You, sir,    Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure    All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction    The by-gone day proclaim'd:   say this to him,    He's beat from his best ward.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-10,"Sir, I'd planned to stay quiet until you'd pushed him to the point of swearing not to stay. You're too hard on him. Tell him everything in Bohemia's finewe heard good news yesterday. If you tell him that, he's lost his best reason for leaving.","  Well said, Hermione.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-11,"Well said, Hermione.","   To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:    But let him say so then, and let him go;    But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,    We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.    Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure    The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia    You take my lord, I'll give him my commission    To let him there a month behind the gest    Prefix'd for's parting:   yet, good deed, Leontes,    I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind    What lady-she her lord.   You'll stay?   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-12,"Of course, that he misses his son is a good excuse. If he says that, we'll let him go. And if he swears that, we'll not only let him go, we'll chase him out the door with frying pans! Despite that, I'll still beg your royal self to stay another week. When my husband goes to Bohemia I'll give him permission to stay there a month past the agreed-upon departure dateand, Leontes, you know I love you not one bit less than any woman loves her husband. [To POLIXENES] Will you stay?","  No, madam.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-13,"No, ma'am.","  Nay, but you will?  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-14,"Oh, please, won't you?","  I may not, verily.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-15,"Truly, I can't.","   Verily!    You put me off with limber vows; but I,    Though you would seek t'unsphere the    stars with oaths,    Should yet say 'Sir, no going.'   Verily,    You shall not go. A lady's 'Verily' is    As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?    Force me to keep you as a prisoner,    Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees    When you depart, and save your thanks.   How say you?    My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'    One of them you shall be.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-16,"""Truly!"" You can keep putting me off with promises, but even if you swore by all the stars in the sky, I'd still say, ""Sir, you're staying."" Truly, you can't leavea woman's ""truly"" is as strong as a man's. Are you still intent on leaving? You'll force me to keep you as a prisoner rather than as a guest. Instead of thanking me, you'll have to pay your fees when you leave. What do you say to that? Will you be my prisoner, or my guest? Judging by your oh-so-serious ""truly,"" you'll have to be one of them.","  Your guest, then, madam:To be your prisoner should import offending;Which is for me less easy to commitThan you to punish.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-17,"I'll be your guest, then. For me to be your prisoner would imply that I'd committed some crime against you. It'd be harder for me to do that than it would be for you to punish me.","  Not your gaoler, then,But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question youOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:You were pretty lordings then?  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-18,"Then I'm not your jailer; I'm your kind hostess. Come on, I'll ask you all about your and my husband's shenanigans back when you were kids.

the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-19,"We were two kids who lived like there was no tomorrow, and thought we'd be boys forever.",  Was not my lordThe verier wag o' the two?  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-20,And wasn't my husband the bigger troublemaker out of you two?,"   We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,    And bleat the one at the other:   what we changed    Was innocence for innocence; we knew not    The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd    That any did.   Had we pursued that life,    And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd    With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven    Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd    Hereditary ours.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-21,"We were like two lambs that frolicked in the sunshine and bleated to each other; we were completely innocent and knew nothing about evil. We couldn't even comprehend evil. If we'd stayed like that, and we'd never had to grow up, we could have gone to heaven and honestly told God that we'd never sinned.",  By this we gatherYou have tripp'd since.  
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-22,Should we take that to mean that you've slipped up since then?,   O my most sacred lady!    Temptations have since then been born to's; for    In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;    Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes    Of my young play-fellow.   
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-23,"Oh, you virtuous woman! We have definitely come across temptation since then. But back in those days, my wife was still a young girl, and you hadn't yet caught my young playmate's eye.","   Grace to boot!    Of this make no conclusion, lest you say    Your queen and I are devils:   yet go on;    The offences we have made you do we'll answer,    If you first sinn'd with us and that with us    You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not    With any but with us.

the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-29,"Never, except once.","   What! have I twice said well? when was't before?    I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's    As fat as tame things:   one good deed dying tongueless    Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.    Our praises are our wages:   you may ride's    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere    With spur we beat an acre.   But to the goal:    My last good deed was to entreat his stay:    What was my first?   it has an elder sister,    Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!    But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?    Nay, let me have't; I long.   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-30,"What? Have I said the right thing twice? When was the first time? Please tell me. Butter me up with praise 'til I'm as fat as a pig for the slaughter. If you don't compliment a good deed, you'll stop that person from doing a thousand more good things that person might have done. Your compliments are my reward. For a single kiss, you can ride me for a mile before you'd have to kick me with your spurs. Back to the point: if my most recent accomplishment was convincing him to stay, what was the first one? This accomplishment must have a sister, unless I misunderstood you. If only her name were ""Grace!"" There was another time I said something good? What was it? Please tell me; I'm dying to know.","   Why, that was when    Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,    Ere I could make thee open thy white hand    And clap thyself my love:   then didst thou utter    'I am yours for ever.'

the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-31,"Obviously that was when, after three long, bitter months, I convinced you to give me your hand in marriage. At that moment, you said, ""I am yours forever.""","  'Tis grace indeed.Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;The other for some while a friend.  "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-32,"That was definitely ""grace,"" wasn't it? Well, look at that, I've said the right thing two whole times. The first time, I earned a royal husband forever; the second time, I earned a friend for a while.","   [Aside]     Too hot, too hot!    To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.    I have    tremor cordis    on me: my heart dances;    But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment    May a free face put on, derive a liberty    From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,    And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;    But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,    As now they are, and making practised smiles,    As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere    The mort o' the deer;   O, that is entertainment    My bosom likes not, nor my brows!   Mamillius,    Art thou my boy?   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-33,"[To himself] Too far, too far! Friendships that get too close always end with the ""friends"" having sex. I'm having a heart attack. My heart is racing, but not with excitementdefinitely not. They might as well be relaxed and open with each other here at the party, and blame it on the plentiful food and drink. But holding hands and linking fingers, and smiling stupidly at each other and sighing as if they were having an orgasmthat kind of ""party"" hurts my heart and my head.[To MAMILLIUS] Mamillius, are you my son?","  Ay, my good lord.

Mine honest friend,    Will you take eggs for money?   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-42,"No, really, I'm fine. [To himself] See how our bodies give us away, giving other people a chance to laugh at us! Just now, looking at my son's face, I went back in time twenty-three years and saw myself back before I wore pants, in my green velvet coat, with a blunt practice sword (it was blunt so that I didn't cut myself, since that kind of toy is dangerous when you're a kid). Back then I was so much like this kid. [To MAMILLIUS] Buddy, would you let yourself be robbed?","  No, my lord, I'll fight.  "

Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I    Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue    Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour    Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.    There have been,    Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;    And many a man there is, even at this present,    Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,    That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence    And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by    Sir Smile, his neighbour:   nay, there's comfort in't    Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,    As mine, against their will. Should all despair    That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind    Would hang themselves.   Physic for't there is none;    It is a bawdy planet, that will strike    Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,    From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,    No barricado for a belly; know't;    It will let in and out the enemy    With bag and baggage: many thousand on's    Have the disease, and feel't not.   How now, boy!   "
the-winters-tale-act-1-scene-2.json-line-48,"Do whatever you want. I'll find you as long as you're underneath the sky.[To himself] I'm reeling them in now, even if you can't see my fishing line. Oh, come on! Look how she holds up her mouth, her lips to him! As confidently as if he were her own husband! [POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and their servants leave] There they go! I'm in thick and deep, over my head, and horns are sprouting above my ears! [To MAMILLIUS] Go play, boyplay! Your mother's playing, and I play such a horrible part that its reviews will put me in my grave; booing and hissing will be the last thing I hear.[To the audience] Unless I'm mistaken, plenty of men have been cheated on by their wives before now. There may even be a man here, as I'm speaking, holding his wife by the arm not knowing she slept with someone else while he was gone. Little does he know that his neighbor (you know the one, Mr. Smiley) stuck his fishing rod in that pond while he was out of town. It's actually comforting to know that I'm not alone in having something taken from me against my will. If all men who've been cheated on gave up on themselves, ten percent of the male population would hang themselves. There's no solution to it.

Carelessness, stupidity, and fear are just part of being in the world; you can't avoid them. As long as I've worked for you, sir, any time I messed up, it was because I was stupid. If I acted stupidly, it's because I made a mistake and didn't think it through.

You, my lord, best know,    Who least will seem to do so, my past life    Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,    As I am now unhappy;   which is more    Than history can pattern, though devised    And play'd to take spectators.   For behold me    A fellow of the royal bed (which owe    A moiety of the throne), a great king's daughter,    The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing    To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore    Who please to come and hear.   For life, I prize it    As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,    'Tis a derivative from me to mine,    And only that I stand for.   I appeal    To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes    Came to your court, how I was in your grace,    How merited to be so;   since he came,    With what encounter so uncurrent I    Have strain'd to appear thus:   i   f one jot beyond    The bound of honour, or in act or will    That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts    Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin    Cry fie upon my grave!   "
the-winters-tale-act-3-scene-2.json-line-4,"Since what I'm about to say can only be a rejection of my accusations, and the only testimony this court will hear on my behalf is my own, it's hardly worth it for me to say ""not guilty."" Since you've already decided I'm a liar, you'll only interpret my words as lies. But listen: if God watches over us, as he does, then I'm sure that innocence will triumph over false accusations, and that patience will defeat tyranny. [To LEONTES] You should know better than anyone (though, at the moment, you seem to know the least) how pure and faithful I've been my entire life. No falsified history can change that, no matter how well it's fabricated and performed for spectators. Look at me: I'm the king's wife (making me half of the royal government), the daughter of a powerful king, the mother of a young prince, and I'm standing here babbling on to defend my life and reputation to any old person who'll come and listen. Honestly? My life is about as precious to me as my grief, which I'd rather not have to bear. I care about my reputation because it affects my children's future; that's the only reason I stand here now.Sir, I appeal to your own conscience. Remember how much you loved meand how much I deserved itbefore Polixenes came to your court. Since he came, I've only tried to remain worthy of your love. If I've done a single thing outside the demands of duty, either in thought or deed, then everyone who hears me can hate me and my own family can curse my grave!",  I ne'er heard yetThat any of these bolder vices wantedLess impudence to gainsay what they didThan to perform it first.

For Polixenes,    With whom I am accused, I do confess    I loved him as in honour he required,    With such a kind of love as might become    A lady like me, with a love even such,    So and no other, as yourself commanded:    Which not to have done I think had been in me    Both disobedience and ingratitude    To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,    Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely    That it was yours.   Now, for conspiracy,    I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd    For me to try how: all I know of it    Is that Camillo was an honest man;    And why he left your court, the gods themselves,    Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.   "
the-winters-tale-act-3-scene-2.json-line-8,"I can't admit to things that I haven't done. As far as Polixenes is concerned, I can only confess that I loved him as much as I should, with the kind of love that a woman in my position should givethe kind of love that you, yourself, commanded that I show. If I hadn't cared for him, I would have been disobedient to you and inhospitable toward your friend. I mean, you've loved Polixenes since before you could speak, since you were a baby, and he's always loved you back. As for conspiracy: I've never tasted it, despite the fact that you keep serving it to me on a plate. All I know is that Camillo was an honest man. God only knows why he left your court; I have no idea.","  You knew of his departure, as you knowWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.  "

the-winters-tale-act-3-scene-2.json-line-11,"Your actions are my dreams! Oh, so you had Polixenes's bastard, and I just dreamed it? Like all of your kind, you're past shame, past truth.

I've never seen anything so sad and so completely beautiful. In pure white robes, like a goddess, she walked toward the place where I was sleeping. She bowed three times, gasping as she tried to speak. Crying with rage, she finally burst out, ""Antigonus, you have the bad luck to be disposing of my baby far away in Bohemia. Shed a tear as you leave her there. Since she's lost forever, you should call her 'Perdita.' And for what my husband has made you do, you'll never see your wife, Paulina, again."" Then, shrieking, she disappeared into thin air. Terrified, it took me a while to collect myself, and I wasn't sure if it was a dream or not. Usually I don't put much stock in dreams, but this one I'd swear by superstitiously. I believe that Hermione died, and that Apollo wants this baby (who must be King Polixenes's daughter) to be laid here on its father's land, to either live or die.

That was the best advertisement, since it sent all the others running to me to get the song for themselves. There was nothing you could do; everyone was singing this god-awful song, non-stop. While they were all lying around, I took the opportunity to pick their pockets and rifled through most of their purses.

[Enter another Gentleman]    Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.    The news, Rogero?   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-3,"I'm not telling the story very well, but the king and Camillo seemed happy to see each other. They stared at each other so intensely it seemed like their eyes would pop out of their heads. They could hardly speak, but they said it all in their hugs and gestures. They looked like they'd seen the world rebuiltor destroyed. They were filled with wonder. But no one who was watching could tell if they were joyful, or sad. It was the extreme version of one of those two.[SECOND GENTLEMAN comes in] Here comes another gentleman who probably knows more. What's the news, Rogero?","  Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; theking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad-makerscannot be able to express it.

This news sounds so much like a fairytale that it can hardly be true. Has the king found his heir?","   Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by    circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you    see, there is such unity in the proofs.   The mantle    of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,    the letters of Antigonus found with it which they    know to be his character, the majesty of the    creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection    of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,    and many other evidences proclaim her with all    certainty to be the king's daughter.

the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-5,"It's really true, if we can believe the circumstances. You might have to see the evidence to believe it: Hermione's scarf, her necklace, letters in Antigonus's handwriting, the girl's resemblance to her mother, her obvious nobility which proves she's not a shepherdess . . . all this and more proves that she's the king's daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?",  No.  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-6,No.,"   Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,    cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one    joy crown another, so and in such manner that it    seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their    joy waded in tears.   There was casting up of eyes,    holding up of hands, with countenances of such    distraction that they were to be known by garment,    not by favour.   Our king, being ready to leap out of    himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that    joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,    thy mother!'   then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then    embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his    daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old    shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten    conduit of many kings' reigns.   I never heard of such    another encounter, which lames report to follow it    and undoes description to do it.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-7,"You missed a sight to be seen; I can't really explain it in words. They were so overjoyed that both of them were moved to tears.

Leonteswho was about to leap out of his skin, he was so happy he found his daughtercries out, ""Oh, your mother, your mother!"" as if the joy made his grief new, too. He asked Polixenes for forgiveness, then hugged his new son-in-law, then hugged his daughter again, then thanked the old shepherd who stood by like an old watchman.

the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-8,"What happened to Antigonus, who carried the baby to Bohemia?","   Like an old tale still, which will have matter to    rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear    open.   He was torn to pieces with a bear: this    avouches the shepherd's son;   who has not only his    innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a    handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-9,"That's like something out of a fairytale, too, which you won't believe no matter how many times I tell it. He was torn to pieces by a bear, according to the shepherd's son.

But O, the noble    combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in    Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of    her husband, another elevated that the oracle was    fulfilled:   she lifted the princess from the earth,    and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin    her to her heart that she might no more be in danger    of losing.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-11,"The shepherd saw them wreck at the same instant that Antigonus died, so everything that brought the child to them disappeared at the moment she was found. But poor Paulinashe was torn between joy and grief! She was crying for her husband, but rejoicing that the oracle was fulfilled. She kept hugging the princess, as if she would hold her to her heart forever so that she'd never be lost again.",  The dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes; for by such was it acted.  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-12,"Kings and princes could have watched a play like that, considering kings and princes were the actors.","   One of the prettiest touches of all and that which    angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not    the fish,   was when, at the relation of the queen's    death, with the manner how she came to't bravely    confessed and lamented by the king,   how    attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one    sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'    I would fain say, bleed tears,   for I am sure my    heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed    colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world    could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-13,"One of the most beautiful parts of it (it brought tears to my eyes) was when the king explained how the queen died, and the poor princess listened to the whole thing, crying, saying ""Oh, no!"" and practically bleeding tears. I think my heart wept blood. Even the most unemotional people there nearly fainted, and everyone cried. If the whole world had seen it, the sadness would have been universal.",  Are they returned to the court?  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-14,Did they go back to the court?,"   No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,    which is in the keeping of Paulina,   a piece many    years in doing and now newly performed by that rare    Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself    eternity and could put breath into his work, would    beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her    ape:   he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that    they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of    answer: thither with all greediness of affection    are they gone, and there they intend to sup.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-2.json-line-15,"No, because the princess just heard about the statue of her mother, which Paulina has. It's been in the works for years and was just finished by Julio Romano, the Italian master, whose sculptures are incredibly lifelike. His ""Hermione"" statue looks so much like her that you'd be tempted to speak to it and wait for an answer. They've all hurried to see the statue, and they're planning to have dinner there.","  I thought she had some great matter there in hand;for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, eversince the death of Hermione, visited that removedhouse.

I told him what I'd heard about the bag and whatnot, but he was too busy worrying about the shepherd's daughter (as he thought she was then), who was sea-sick, and then he got sea-sick, too because of the storm. So the mystery remained unsolved. But it's all the same to me; if I'd figured out this secret, it wouldn't have matched up very well with my other crimes. [The SHEPEHERD and the SHEPHERD'S SON come in] Here come the guys I helped against my will, already decked out in their new, fancy clothes.","  Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons anddaughters will be all gentlemen born.

Still, methinks,There is an air comes from her: what fine chiselCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,For I will kiss her.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-21,"Do it, Paulina. This suffering is sweet to me. [Moving closer to HERMIONE] It looks like she's breathing. What artist could sculpt breath? No one make fun of me; I'm going to kiss her.","  Good my lord, forbear:The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your ownWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-22,"Sir, restrain yourself. The red paint on her lips is wet. You'll smudge it if you kiss it, and you'll get oil paint on your own face. Should I close the curtain?","  No, not these twenty years.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-23,"No, never.","  So long could IStand by, a looker on.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-24,"I could stand here forever, too, just looking.","   Either forbear,    Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you    For more amazement.   If you can behold it,    I'll make the statue move indeed, descend    And take you by the hand;   but then you'll think    Which I protest against   I am assisted    By wicked powers.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-25,"Either restrain yourself, leave the chapel, or get ready for more amazement. If you can handle it, I'll make the statue move, walk down, and take you by the hand. But I'm afraid you'll think I'm a witch using black magic.","  What you can make her do,I am content to look on: what to speak,I am content to hear; for 'tis as easyTo make her speak as move.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-26,I'll watch anything you can make her do. I'll listen to anything you can make her say. Surely it's as easy to make her speak as it is to make her move?,"  It is requiredYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;On: those that think it is unlawful businessI am about, let them depart.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-27,You need to have faith. Everyone stand still. And anyone who thinks I'm doing something I shouldn't can leave.,  Proceed:No foot shall stir.  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-28,Proceed. No one will leave.,"  Music, awake her; strike!  [Music]    'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;    Strike all that look upon with marvel.   Come,    I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,    Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him    Dear life redeems you.   You perceive she stirs:    [HERMIONE comes down]    Start not; her actions shall be holy as    You hear my spell is lawful:   do not shun her    Until you see her die again; for then    You kill her double.   Nay, present your hand:    When she was young you woo'd her; now in age    Is she become the suitor?   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-29,"Music, awake her now! [Music begins to play][To HERMIONE] It's time, come down. Don't be a statue anymore. Come to us and you'll amaze all of us who are watching. Come, I'll close your grave. Move! Come on, now, forget death and come back to life.[To LEONTES and the others] Look, she's moving.[HERMIONE steps down from the pedestal and moves toward LEONTES][To LEONTES] Don't be afraid! Everything she does is as safe as my spell, like I told you. Don't reject her until you see her die again, or you'll be killing her a second time. [HERMIONE reaches out her hand, but LEONTES steps back] No, give her your hand. You won her over when she was young. Now that you're old, is she the one who has to win you?","  O, she's warm! If this be magic, let it be an artLawful as eating.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-30,"Wow, she's warm! If this is from your magic spell, your magic should be considered an art as natural as eating.",  She embraces him.  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-31,She's hugging him.,  She hangs about his neck:If she pertain to life let her speak too.  
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-32,"She's hanging on his neck. If she's so lifelike, she should speak, too.","  Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,Or how stolen from the dead.  "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-33,"Yes, and tell us where she's been living, or how she's come back from the dead.","   That she is living,    Were it but told you, should be hooted at    Like an old tale:   but it appears she lives,    Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.    Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel    And pray your mother's blessing.   Turn, good lady;    Our Perdita is found.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-34,"If I just told you she was alive, you would write it off as an old fairytale. But even though she hasn't spoken, it certainly looks like she's living. Wait a minute. [To PERDITA] Speak to her, ma'am. Kneel and ask for your mother's blessing. [PERDITA kneels behind HERMIONE][To HERMIONE] Turn around, my lady. Our Perdita is found.","   You gods, look down    And from your sacred vials pour your graces    Upon my daughter's head!   Tell me, mine own.    Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found    Thy father's court?   for thou shalt hear that I,    Knowing by Paulina that the oracle    Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved    Myself to see the issue.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-35,"[Looking up to heaven] God bless you, daughter. Tell me, sweetheart: how did you escape? Where did you live? How did you get back to your father's court? You should know: Paulina told me that the oracle gave us hope that you were still alive. I kept myself going just to see you.","   There's time enough for that;    Lest they desire upon this push to trouble    Your joys with like relation. Go together,    You precious winners all; your exultation    Partake to every one.   I, an old turtle,    Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there    My mate, that's never to be found again,    Lament till I am lost.   "
the-winters-tale-act-5-scene-3.json-line-36,"There's plenty of time for that and to tell all our stories. Go on, all of you lucky people! Go to the feast. Meanwhile, I'll find some lonely place to mourn my husband until I die.","   O, peace, Paulina!    Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,    As I by thine a wife:   this is a match,    And made between's by vows.   Thou hast found mine;    But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,    As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many    A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far    For him, I partly know his mind   to find thee    An honourable husband.   Come, Camillo,    And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty    Is richly noted and here justified    By us, a pair of kings.   Let's from this place.    What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,    That e'er I put between your holy looks    My ill suspicion.   This is your son-in-law,    And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,    Is troth-plight to your daughter.   Good Paulina,    Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely    Each one demand an answer to his part    Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first    We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.   "
